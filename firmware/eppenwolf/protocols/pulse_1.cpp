# For each of the animal and human published studies, four
# predetermined and specific quality control measures were used to
# assess the quality of the publication.
# 1. Whether or not the researchers have used ‘‘blind’’ evaluations to
# avoid individual ‘‘bias’’, B or nB;
# 2. Whether or not there was detailed/adequate description of
# ‘‘dosimetry’’ in the publication for independent replication/
# confirmation studies, D or nD.
# 3. Whether or not ‘‘positive controls’’ were included in the
# experiment(s) to replicate/confirm the observations, P or nP.
# 4. Whether or not ‘‘sham-exposed controls’’ (more appropriate to
# compare with the observations made in RF exposure conditions)
# were included in the experiments, S or nS. However, it was not our
# intention to ‘‘rank’’ the publications either to exclude or include
# the reported data in the meta-analysis.

# Overnight cultures of E. coli were centrifuged and the pellets resuspended in 0.1 mM PB to
# achieve a concentration of 10^10 cfu/mL.
# The resulting suspensions were subject to serial dilution
#
# For each assay, 160 μL of LB were mixed with
# 20 μL phage solution, 20 μL of bacteria solution and 20μL of PB in

"Blank" repeatablity test with just water in all cuvettes


Add a small amount of growing e.coli to a new nutrient broth,
aerate vigorously, then add to culture chamber.
