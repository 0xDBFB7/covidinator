"Each voxel model (.raw) comes with an associated descriptor file (.txt). In this file, the first column gives a unique index for each tissue. Columns 2 to 4 are color codes for the tissues in SEMCAD X and Sim4Life. The last column shows the tissue name. The number and size of the voxels along each direction (x,y,z) is given at the end of the document."
