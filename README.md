Hi! Welcome! I hope you like it :>

Things that are here:

- Pretty bad notes. I'm sorry.
- A cheap photon counting fluorescence reader. Can quantify sub-nanogram quantities of dsDNA using Biotium Gelgreen.
- A cheap 6-12 GHz microwave absorption spectrometer. Almost useless, not a great design.
-- firmware/eppenwolf/runs: Data from a number of data-taking runs of the Eppenwolf.
- A few microbiology protocols.
- A wrapper around flaport/fdtd's awesome library:
-- tissue.py: supports import of IT.IS foundation computational phantom voxel files, with their supplied cole-cole dielectric model, for tissue simulations.
-- PCB.py: A test of coupled NGSPICE - adaptive timestep and direct KiCAD netlist import and probe/source creation. Currently totally broken.
--
- biology/JAMES/ A custom MD program because arbitrary bonds and arbitrary EM forcings seemed hard in GROMACS. Victim of the not-invented-here fallacy. No reason for it to exist, don't use it.
