Hi! Welcome! I hope you like it! 

:> :) :> :) :> :) 

Things that are here:

 * Really bad notes.
 * A cheap (~$300) synchronous photon counting fluorescence reader - just a crappy plate reader/Gel-Doc/spectroflurometer. Can instantly quantify sub-nanogram quantities of dsDNA with Biotium GelGreen (Xu's fast phage titer sampling, score!).
 * A cheap (~$300) 6-12 GHz microwave absorption spectrometer. Almost useless, not a great design.
 * firmware/eppenwolf/runs: Data from a number of data-taking runs of the Eppenwolf.
 * A few microbiology protocols.
 * A wrapper around flaport/fdtd's awesome electromagnetics library:
 - tissue.py: supports import of IT.IS foundation computational phantom voxel files, with their supplied Cole-Cole dielectric model, for tissue simulations. Pretty rough.
 - PCB.py: A test of coupled NGSPICE - adaptive timestep and direct KiCAD netlist import and probe/source creation. Currently totally broken.
 * biology/JAMES/ A bespoke MD program thanks to the not-invented-here syndrome. Not enough time was spent exploring GROMACS and LAMMPS features for bead-spring elastic models. A complete waste of time. There is zero reason for this to exist.

One the one hand, there're some pretty good reasons to want embargoes, like the Ingelfinger rules - no need to lather up a furor just for some idle musings, and publishing too early is a terrible idea. 
On the other hand, embargo rules came from publishers, and it's not obvious that these decisions were not somewhat motivated by financial considerations.
There's a recent movement towards more "live" and open science - it's hard to tell when the, especially in a pandemic. Fortunately, it's not like any of what we're discussing here actually matters, anyways.
