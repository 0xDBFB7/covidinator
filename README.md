Hi! Welcome! There's not a whole lot of real substance here, but maybe you'll find something useful. I hope you like it!

Things that are here:

 * A few microbiology protocols.
 * A cheap (~$300) synchronous photon counting fluorescence reader - just a crappy plate reader/Gel-Doc/spectroflurometer. Can instantly quantify sub-nanogram quantities of dsDNA with Biotium GelGreen (Xu's fast phage titer sampling, score!).
 * A cheap (~$300) 6-12 GHz microwave absorption spectrometer. Almost useless for small signals, not a great design, don't build one.
    - firmware/eppenwolf/runs: Data from a number of data-taking runs of the Eppenwolf.
 * Li et al's 600-picosecond avalanche transistor Marx pulser
 * A wrapper around flaport/fdtd's awesome electromagnetics library:
    - tissue.py: supports import of IT.IS Foundation computational phantom voxel files, with their supplied Cole-Cole dielectric model, for tissue simulations. Pretty rough, not formally validated.
    - PCB.py: A test of coupled NGSPICE - adaptive timestep and direct KiCAD netlist import and probe/source creation. Currently totally broken.
 * biology/JAMES/ A bespoke MD program thanks to the not-invented-here syndrome. Not enough time was spent exploring GROMACS and LAMMPS features for bead-spring elastic models. A complete waste of time. There is zero reason for this to exist.
 * Bad notes! When the  wanna make a real sweet lab notebook, the current offerings aren't, in my opinion, super great - suggestions for features and workflows are welcome!
