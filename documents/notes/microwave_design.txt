In order to satisfy the Barkhausen condition for oscillation, a 180 degree phase shift is required 
in the feedback loop. The inverting mosfet itself contributes the remaining 180 degrees.

The S-parameters for the CE3520K3 mosfet are listed on the manufacturer's webpage. 

qucs-RFlayout didn't recognize the QUCS file until the version ("0.0.19") was added to the
opening XML tag. #5.

Because of the small engraving bit diameter, we would like to etch a minimum amount of copper.

Microwaves101 says clearance of 3 line widths,
but Digi says clearance of 2 x substrate thickness.

To be safe, we'll go for 5x0.8, or 4 mm clearance.

A matching network isn't strictly necessary if the gain is satisfactory [mwrf]. The S-parameters
provided by the manufacturer are given relative to a 50-ohm impedance. 

The S-parameter table shows us that at 8 GHz, the transistor does not produce the 180 degree phase
shift that was expected. The S21 mag,angle (@2v, 50 Ohm, 10 ma) varies from 4.7, 149 deg at 2 GHz to 
4.1, 62 deg at 8 GHz.

That's a clue as to why the most recent LO test didn't work.
