In order to satisfy the Barkhausen condition for oscillation, a 180 degree phase shift is required 
in the feedback loop. The inverting mosfet itself contributes the remaining 180 degrees.

The S-parameters for the CE3520K3 mosfet are listed on the manufacturer's webpage.

Microwaves101 says clearance of 3 line widths,
