> You recommend holding a culture at room temperature, but the recommended temperature for Escherichia coli is listed in your catalog as 37° C. Why is that?
> This is because 37° C is the incubation temperature, or the temperature needed for maximum culture growth. The culture is mature when we ship it and does not need further incubation. Maintaining the culture at room temperature allows you to hold it longer before use.

Okay so E. Coli stays at RT, phage goes in the fridge. No, wait, the package says specifically 
"refrigerate after arrival".

Cultures must be shaken and must have sufficient oxygen for growth.

Culture was put in the fridge at 2.9 C.

Sterilized alu foil can be used to cap beakers n' stuff. Neat.

12-50ml Falkon tubes are used to culture in shakers. Oh well.
