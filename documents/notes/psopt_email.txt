Hi! PSOPT is terrific!

To Professor Becerra: the psopt.org website domain appears to have expired.

1. Probably everyone already knows this, but compiling PSOPT with 

set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-O2") [ or -Ofast   ]

in CMakeLists.txt greatly improves the simulation speed in my case.

2.

A team at LANL have incorporated the CUDA GPU-accelerated solver SPRAL as a solver for Ipopt. Following the instructions here seemed to work, though I didn't see any improvement in speed. Might be worthwhile 

3.

I had a problem involving requiring the second derivative of a control in the DAE. The get_control_derivative function works great for the first derivative, but it wasn't obvious to me how I could get the second derivative that way. 

also, for large node counts it seems to put too much in the
