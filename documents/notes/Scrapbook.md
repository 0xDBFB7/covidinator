*asciientist*

- Available over HTTP - maybe that should be seperate?

- Text files always remain human-readable

- Concat files horizontally, each with a title (with vertical rulers between), to stay within 100-col limit (configurable) but allow scrolling horizontally.

- Save in txt; don't support markdown options.

- Box colors? Where is it saved?

- Drag-n-drop image linking - how will that work for local files? Webcam previewing? Audio recording? Video recording? Video trimming to size, jumping to correct time?

- Images are just a little box with a tiny preview, expand out

- "Saved" flashes breifly

- latex - KaTeX snippet at the top on html export

- Readable on small devices?

- BibTeX - no, zotero! integration

- .bash_history, script-like? integration, but retroactive too -> choose command lines and output you want to assemble into install instructions

- Link objects together (date tag on a box, perhaps) so they move together spatially

- Code, too! Runnable python inline! Oh boy!

- Zotero notes are integrated properly

- Settings (media folder) and binary appended to the end of file to work better with version control

docear is basically what I want.

Here's why I'm spending all this time: this is a medical device, I don't want to screw up the science, rigor is now essential, and I'm wasting a lot of time looking for things I've already found.

There's really four regimes we have to provide for here:

- Quick, context-free note-taking in-situ - unreadable after a short period, not human readable extenrally

- Linearly logging what was believed and considered at what time - crucially, without going back and updating as new information is added.

  Currently I'm only operating in this regime - new info is appended to the bottom of the document without any updates. Auditable lab notebooks would seem to fulfil the same function, but everyone's better at them.

  In some ways git fulfils this function with an ELN.

- Rigorously documenting what was established and tested for future reference

- Production-quality final paper

Zotero provides pdf names in the RDF file. cites should link to the local pdf?




Workflows that integrate both software workflows and IRL experiments; timers for processes, etc; records runs and 


instant searching of all text like zotero

zotero integration

extremely fast user interface that doesn't interfere with thinking while observing experiments
