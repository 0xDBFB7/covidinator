*asciientist*

- Available over HTTP - maybe that should be seperate?

- Text files always remain human-readable

- Concat files horizontally, each with a title (with vertical rulers between), to stay within 100-col limit (configurable) but allow scrolling horizontally.

- Save in txt; don't support markdown options.

- Box colors? Where is it saved?

- Drag-n-drop image linking - how will that work for local files? Webcam previewing? Audio recording? Video recording? Video trimming to size, jumping to correct time?

- Images are just a little box with a tiny preview, expand out

- "Saved" flashes breifly

- latex - KaTeX snippet at the top on html export

- Readable on small devices?

- BibTeX - no, zotero! integration

- .bash_history, script-like? integration, but retroactive too -> choose command lines and output you want to assemble into install instructions

- Link objects together (date tag on a box, perhaps) so they move together spatially 

- Code, too! Runnable python inline! Oh boy!

- Zotero notes are integrated properly

- Settings (media folder) and binary appended to the end of file to work better with version control
