-------------Focus on the board for now----------

routing the board. Way too much to cut (6 inches long) with the little engraving bit;
a 1/32" cutter is going to be used.




built the board. 

the little yellow-transformer PSU works great. Had to add 4700 pF and a rectifier to smooth things
out 

maybe the generator is working fine - it's just too fast?
no, that's not plausible. the time constant should be the same for all the caps.
Oak use a 

With the ON semi transistors and Oak 1991  test jig (fig 1), (albeit with a 50pf cap
and 100k resistor)
I only get a 100v pulse.

whoa! with the micro-commercial-co 5551s, 252V!!!!


interestingly, one of the transistors didn't work at all.
232v,


about 20 ns fall time - trigger pulse isn't great
might need that ECL driver to properly trigger... 

first 4 transistors make a nice pulse, but it just decays back down. perhaps the capacitors
are not of sufficeintyl low ESR? The first stage swings ~300v, the capacitor drops about 50v,

at about 320V, the pulse starts to form maybe 5 stages down. 50 v amplitude.

at 340, the whole line breaks down.
some ripple. added 0.1 uF foil caps. 

no dice. no pulse.

putting two 5551s in parallel makes no difference either.

the dtic paper mentions 2n3700s as being good. there's an SMD verion, the 2n3700 UB.


capaciors are also the cheaper ones, too.


using 10M rather than 100k seems to have made a small difference.




The hand-formable coax cable I bought, a CCSMA-MM-086-12, attenuates -0.82 dB/foot at 12 GHz.
about 0.83x power and 0.90x field. no problemo.


rebuilt the generator with the FMMT417s and the ATC 100B caps.
With a 1 GS/sec 150 MHz scope and 100 MHz probe, we get a falling edge of 0.6 nanoseconds
and a pulse width of ~3 ns. 
that's with 12V to the converter, btw.
Stable at 305 V (~3v of ripple) - probably higher too but scared
be interesting to see if the caps or the fets were responsible.

with a coplanar exposure jig and the semirigid coax, 
plus direct grounding of the probe rather than the lead,
falling edge seems to be around 1.5 ns now, 450V:
however, we're way past the bandwidth of any of the components so none of this is reliable.



testing the trigger pulse generator - NAND and AND gates. straight through is too fast;
about a 1 ns pulse, and it doesn't get all the way up. needs to be slowed slightly.

both delay line and thinger works great.
