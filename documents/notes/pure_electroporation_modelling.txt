Kotnik has a good body of work in this field. Not FDTD wave-propagation like, but close enough. 
Kotnik 2006 gives a kotnik 1998-like laplace method for organelles (huge increase in organelle)

Kotnik 2000 (second-order) discusses relaxation (debye) effects a little more, but not much


There's a curious pulse that looks like an AC-coupling, negative polarity, 
that occurs near tau_2 and with the same relaxation time. It's extremely high amplitude compared
to the rest of the pulse...not sure if it's an artifact?
occurs even if only a single ramp is used - might be due to the inflection point of t=0?


it might be difficult to solve the thing for a maximum-value constraint;
however, integrating is probably an even better way

neither Mathematica or sympy 

grosse and schwan 1992 actually explicitly consider a surface conductance. very important stuff in notes
