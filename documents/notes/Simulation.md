Simulation

## Simulation

The s3d version of cm2 doesn't seem to work on this machine. using the latest other one.

We'll probably want to compare with the AFM force results to make sure we're doing

The T4 phage capsid is made up of gp23 ( and gp24 (PDB:1YUE) proteins.

"What determines how rigid the capsid is? To answer this question, a icosahedral capsids of a number of viruses were simulated, with the sizes from 17 to 75 nm, over times of 5 to 25 microseconds. Presently, all-atom simulation of any of these viruses on a microsecond timescale would be technically impossible; the CG technique is therefore playing here a role of the bridge that helps to transfer the knowledge about the atomistic structure of the studied system into the knowledge about the large-scale movements of the system."

" Furthermore, the lambda and phi29 capsids break at indentations of 20-25 % of their radius and show material fatigue under repeated small indentations."

Aha! That could be the mechanism behind long durations. 

*"Kalzium and Avogadro programs"*

To install Avogadro, needed openbabel.

We could just model the membrane and payload with FEM or something; but I'm a bit concerned about the polarity and charge distribution.

The payload DNA inside the capsid can greatly modify the stiffness of the capsid.

"proheads would still recover to their normal height after such large deformations, even after pushing repetitively, tens of times, on the same location. Height recovery took place faster than 4 ms, and thus the relaxation time of the proheads was less than that. At forces beyond â‰ˆ2.8 nN, there were significant deviations from linearity, with the slope of the FZ curves decreasing (Fig. 4A )."

What sort of motion would speed up fatigue? How can we test if fatigue is even the regime that we're interested in? Timing before fracture?

But these guys just sim'd the capsid whole. Huh.

DNA has a negative charge, the quantity of which is pretty hard to tease out but probably around 0.1e- per BP.

The T4 is basically exactly the same size as COVID.

Tried VMD, didn't start, gave up. LAMMPS, AMBER, 

The inside of the phage capsid is under huge pressure - like 60 atm. Neat!

"The Lennard-Jones potential is totally inadequate for open shell systems,
in which strong localized bonds are formed."

this sort of coarse sim is called a "bead-spring" sim or "bead-spring polymer"

"In that case, for a coarse-grained model such as this, I suggest
either moltemplate or topotools.  (Disclaimer: I wrote one of these
tools.)"

LAMMPS et al just take a file with positions of atoms and bond directions etc. There's a step called "solvation" which adds the solvent (water etc) surrounding the atom

LAMMPS has a larger userbase, but stuff like variable e-fields seem to be more difficult. Let's see how gromacs fares.
