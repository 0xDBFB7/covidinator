"Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aureus 489." 

It'll have to do.

Bleach is another option.

A nephelometer or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFarland_standards is used to determine titer of a broth. Looks like an LED and photodetector at 90 deg would be sufficient.

Rubber cap strip for all tubes?

Bubble aeration - we'll try it!

Water bath for robot pipettes

Automatically sequentially diluting will also work.

> You recommend holding a culture at room temperature, but the recommended temperature for Escherichia coli is listed in your catalog as 37° C. Why is that?
> This is because 37° C is the incubation temperature, or the temperature needed for maximum culture growth. The culture is mature when we ship it and does not need further incubation. Maintaining the culture at room temperature allows you to hold it longer before use.

Okay so E. Coli stays at RT, phage goes in the fridge. The phage package says specifically 
"refrigerate after arrival".

Cultures must be shaken and must have sufficient oxygen for growth.

Culture was put in the fridge at 2.9 C.

Sterilized alu foil can be used to cap beakers n' stuff. Neat. Definitely should have purchased some parafilm though, because of its gas permeability.

12-50ml Falkon tubes are used to culture in shakers. Oh well.

> [NAMDwill be used for groundbreaking coronavirus simulations](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/coronavirus-massive-simulations-completed-on-frontera-supercomputer/) that will run on the Frontera supercomputer at TACC. The Amaro Lab of UC San Diego is working to build the first complete all-atom model of the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus envelope in order to investigate how the virus interacts with receptors within the host cell membrane. The coronavirus model is anticipated to contain 200 million atoms. The simulations will run on up to 4,000 nodes or about 250,000 processing cores of Frontera.  

Very nice! So all-atom sims are totally within our grasp now.

Autoclave diagnostic tapes! cool.

"Anyone employing an incubator shaker (thermal shaker) to grow yeast or bacteria in the laboratory needs to beware that under the usual conditions encountered in the lab, the rate at which oxygen diffuses from the gaseous phase into the shaken liquid phase is too slow to keep up with the rate at which the oxygen is consumed by for example E coli dividing every half hour or S cerevisiae dividing every hour. If the investigator measure the oxygen in the shake flask on the shaker -- polarographically, for example -- at mid-exponential phase of growth, the dissolved oxygen concentration will turn out to be zero."

How about a vortex mixer? Small vortexers for 1.5 mL tubes do exist. 

Oh this'll select for resistance to microwaves. Is that even possible? Perhaps mutants of different dimensions will be favored, in which case it should be possible for users to re-tune without re-issuing.
