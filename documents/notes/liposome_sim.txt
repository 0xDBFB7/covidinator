Chimera seems to bork when loading the 4 M atom file.

dccmd might be good, a few us / day at 160k particles, but does it do electric field? And also
conversions are required

n. In general, however, the time scale of the Martini simulations has to be interpreted with care.

Martini has been parameterized using time steps in the range of 20-40 fs. Whether you can use 40 fs or have to settle for a somewhat smaller time step depends on your system, and on your attitude toward coarse-grained modeling, as explained below.

Lipid force fields
• Groups: phosphate, choline, glycerol, acyl
• Surprisingly hard to get accurate results
• Many force fields lead to lipid area & volumes
that are 20% lower than experimental values!

One reason for the difficulties in simulating
membranes is the sensitivity to nonbonded
Van der Waals parameters
