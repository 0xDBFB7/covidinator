Chimera seems to bork when loading the 4 M atom file.

dccmd might be good, a few us / day at 160k particles, but does it do electric field? And also
conversions are required

n. In general, however, the time scale of the Martini simulations has to be interpreted with care.

Martini has been parameterized using time steps in the range of 20-40 fs. Whether you can use 40 fs or have to settle for a somewhat smaller time step depends on your system, and on your attitude toward coarse-grained modeling, as explained below.

Lipid force fields
• Groups: phosphate, choline, glycerol, acyl
• Surprisingly hard to get accurate results
• Many force fields lead to lipid area & volumes
that are 20% lower than experimental values!

One reason for the difficulties in simulating
membranes is the sensitivity to nonbonded
Van der Waals parameters

the martini lipid net charges are in the itp.

do an impulse response


tried CHARMM-gui martini maker vescile builder for the fun of it, it crashed - oops, sorry

may have to switch to stiff during minimization see martini .itp

lloooooots of lincs warnings.

vmd works great

if you get a atom W not found, you need to add the main martini itp

got a segfault when fmax was above e5. ran minimize a little longer.

gromacs hung: dt was too large (>10 fs doesn't work) for some reasong.

I really, really like TRAVIS's input questionaire system! It probably isn't optimal
for most types of programs, but it's very thoughtfully designed

a big part of setting up a simulation
 is knowing what sensible defaults exist and why certain decisions should be made - 
 it seems like they nailed it here

 wrapping with all PUPI didn't work at all - instability, Fmax=1e5
A mix of 1PUPI to 3 POPC worked great.

Used RMSD visualizer with "name PO4 or name NA" works great. Graphics-representations also is good.


Aha! RMSD at a certain frequency depends greatly on the tau_t value using a berendstend thermo.
Solvent tau of 4 and a lipid tau of 20 yields a sizable increase.

Altering the lipid tau_t has a surprisingly small effect on the shape of the spectrum; 
a small increase in the height of the peak.


aha, this is called "non-equilibrium MD".

Warning: atom name 1251287 in output/topol.top and ./output/s3/solvated.gro does not match (W - W2)

verify that that's working properly

hang on a min, if 4 ps damping is actually reasonable for solvent, why would a non-eq
sim be more meaninful? 

really a friction term would be better, but whatever

this is interesting: the inside and outside have two different modes and are decoupled!

why isn't there an overshoot in the sim that would indicate Q>1?

OOOH Yu et al have made a CG model of the virion! Yaaay!

Unfortunately, high dsRNA.

In fact, there's some reason to believe that an extremely high statistical certainty in
an otherwise inconsistent field is an artifact of systematics?


------------ Rotation ---------------

rotating the liposome. 10 deg/ps caused lincs warnings. 1 deg/ps doesnt.
probably a timestep effect.
That's 17.4 GHz (1/ps).

Very pretty "slip" boundary at the liposome. very cool.

torque tau0 stabilizes at 1e6 kg/mol = 1.661e-15 Nm.



The liposome radius is 150 nm. Area = 4 pi r^2.

Can expect the ~16x higher ((60)^2 / (15)^2).

2.6e-14 Nm. 

>>> (2.6e-14 N m) / 60 nm -> nanonewton

  2.6e-14 N × m / 60 nm ➞ nN

   = 433.333 nN

oof!

k = 1.48571e-24 N·m·s/rad

At a megavolt and 1e2 charge, 0.5 picometers, we get freq = 3e4. Maaaaaybe?

Given that previous electrorotation of influenza only report laser induced damage, even 
at really high fields, it hardly seems plausible that a few rpm are going to matter.

THOMAS SCHNELLE

It was said that electrorotation was not sufficient to determine the species of the thing.
But is that really true nowadays? Maybe this warrants more work... 

There are no papers on COVID electrorotation since 2019!!!!!!

ah, this isc alled "electrokinetics".

For each particle type, there exists a near unique
profile of particle rotation rate with varying applied electric
field frequency for a given environmental condition.

"Smaller particles can also be investigated without changing the equipment configuration, with a theoretical particle
diameter limitation of 800 nm proposed by Eppman
(Eppman et al. 1996). However, in 1999, Gimsa reported
electrorotation of the influenza virus (Gimsa 1999), although
this may have been due to clusters of viruses rather that an
individual virus being rotated."



We want to detect - say - down to 1000 particles (nasal sample...). 

Schnelle is a good search term for this.

The great thing about electrorotation is that it will be synchronous; there'll be a 
distinctive 

Unfortunately it seems like it needs a probe beam or other sort of optical detector to get
the low-level sensing.
maybe secondary sensing probes?
