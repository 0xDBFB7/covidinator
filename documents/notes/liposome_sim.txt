Chimera seems to bork when loading the 4 M atom file.

dccmd might be good, a few us / day at 160k particles, but does it do electric field? And also
conversions are required

n. In general, however, the time scale of the Martini simulations has to be interpreted with care.

Martini has been parameterized using time steps in the range of 20-40 fs. Whether you can use 40 fs or have to settle for a somewhat smaller time step depends on your system, and on your attitude toward coarse-grained modeling, as explained below.

Lipid force fields
• Groups: phosphate, choline, glycerol, acyl
• Surprisingly hard to get accurate results
• Many force fields lead to lipid area & volumes
that are 20% lower than experimental values!

One reason for the difficulties in simulating
membranes is the sensitivity to nonbonded
Van der Waals parameters

"g_density
You need to provide electrons.dat with
number of electrons/atom, see -h flag."

the martini lipid net charges are in the itp.

do an impulse response


tried CHARMM-gui martini maker vescile builder for the fun of it, it crashed - oops, sorry

may have to switch to stiff during minimization see martini .itp

lloooooots of lincs warnings.

vmd works great

if you get a atom W not found, you need to add the main martini itp

got a segfault when fmax was above e5. ran minimize a little longer.

switching from Pwater to water fixed links warnings.

gromacs hung: dt was too large (>10 fs doesn't work) for some reasong.

vmd:

set PLUGINDIR
make LINUXAMD64

scratch that. Download a precompiled,  then do

done.


I really, really like TRAVIS's input questionaire system! It probably isn't optimal
for most types of programs, but it's very thoughtfully designed

a big part of setting up a simulation
 is knowing what sensible defaults exist and why certain decisions should be made - 
 it seems like they nailed it here

 wrapping with all PUPI didn't work at all - instability, Fmax=1e5
A mix of 1PUPI to 3 POPC worked great.

Used RMSD visualizer with "name PO4 or name NA" works great. Graphics-representations also is good.
