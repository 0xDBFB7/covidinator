Sparselizard is amazing, but tequires PB in a "weak form" 
sympde can solve those?
could solve using the analytic potential in that paper and then distribute the charge correctly

git-annex is awesome!


cmake .. -DBLAS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/openblas/ -DBLAS_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/openblas-base/lib -DMETIS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/ -DMETIS_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/ -DSLEPC_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/ -D SLEPC_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib

aha, dielectric is also equal to the diffusion coefficient

Spherical_multipole_moments

only DelPhi <5.4 supports non-atom objects

DelPhi really isn't going to work for this.

4 ways of doing force 
maxwell stress tensor

pygbe allows a field to be applied!

there's a "dielectric boundary" force -  I don't think we actually need to model that?

APBS documentation:

zero “Zero” boundary condition. Dirichlet conditions where the potential at the boundary is set to zero. This
condition is not commonly used and can result in large errors if used inappropriately.

okay, so let's recap. We've got 

holy crap! MEDUSA is amazing! takes the *strong form*!
