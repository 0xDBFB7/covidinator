sympde can solve those?
could solve using the analytic potential in that paper and then distribute the charge correctly

git-annex is awesome!

aha, dielectric is also equal to the diffusion coefficient

Spherical_multipole_moments

only DelPhi <5.4 supports non-atom objects

DelPhi really isn't going to work for this.

4 ways of doing force 
maxwell stress tensor

pygbe allows a field to be applied!

there's a "dielectric boundary" force -  I don't think we actually need to model that?

APBS documentation:

zero “Zero” boundary condition. Dirichlet conditions where the potential at the boundary is set to zero. This
condition is not commonly used and can result in large errors if used inappropriately.

okay, so let's recap. We've got 

holy crap! MEDUSA is amazing! takes the *strong form*!


devito looks cool, 
julia 

albany too,


mathematica is pretty sweet for this. don't need to worry about units or normalization,
it works fine no matter what.

space charge thing here is pretty cool

so solving the nonlinear PB problem seems to be pretty tricky. I will use DelPhi in the geometric mode
to get the charge map, then apply that to a mesh.

so delphi 77 flatly refuses to solve the problem when the sphere is bigger than 300 angstroms.
whoops!

this is all overkill since the pb field is analytic from that paper - just too lazy to 
figure out the dimensional analysis and re-jig for concentration

actually that wouldn't be all that hard. just multiply the field by the Ke.
huh...

tried AFMPB - only supports i386?!? that can't be right.



can we just superimpose the Z field and then integrate? does superposition hold in this case
in the non-equilibrium, infinitesimal limit? have to worry about the dielectric...

in the Brackley paper units are phi = kB T / e0



" the  E -field (and hence the potential gradient) being larger in the medium with the smaller permittivity."
right.

so:

assuming superposition.

determine constant radial electric field at R: derivative of eq. 21. 
convert to V/m. 

in the integral, figure out component of ^ field in the +z direction

divide by 80 permittivity (worst case)
