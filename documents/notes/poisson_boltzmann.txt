Sparselizard is amazing, but tequires PB in a "weak form" 
sympde can solve those?
could solve using the analytic potential in that paper and then distribute the charge correctly

git-annex is awesome!

aha, dielectric is also equal to the diffusion coefficient

Spherical_multipole_moments

only DelPhi <5.4 supports non-atom objects

DelPhi really isn't going to work for this.

4 ways of doing force 
maxwell stress tensor

pygbe allows a field to be applied!

there's a "dielectric boundary" force -  I don't think we actually need to model that?
