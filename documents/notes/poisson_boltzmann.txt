sympde can solve those?
could solve using the analytic potential in that paper and then distribute the charge correctly

git-annex is awesome!

aha, dielectric is also equal to the diffusion coefficient

Spherical_multipole_moments

only DelPhi <5.4 supports non-atom objects

DelPhi really isn't going to work for this.

4 ways of doing force 
maxwell stress tensor

pygbe allows a field to be applied!

there's a "dielectric boundary" force -  I don't think we actually need to model that?

APBS documentation:

zero “Zero” boundary condition. Dirichlet conditions where the potential at the boundary is set to zero. This
condition is not commonly used and can result in large errors if used inappropriately.

okay, so let's recap. We've got 

holy crap! MEDUSA is amazing! takes the *strong form*!


devito looks cool, 
julia 

albany too,


mathematica is pretty sweet for this. don't need to worry about units or normalization,
it works fine no matter what.

space charge thing here is pretty cool

so solving the nonlinear PB problem seems to be pretty tricky. I will use DelPhi in the geometric mode
to get the charge map, then apply that to a mesh.

so delphi 77 flatly refuses to solve the problem when the sphere is bigger than 300 angstroms.
whoops!

this is all overkill since the pb field is analytic from that paper - just too lazy to 
figure out the dimensional analysis and re-jig for concentration

actually that wouldn't be all that hard. just multiply the field by the Ke.
huh...

tried AFMPB - only supports i386?!? that can't be right.



can we just superimpose the Z field and then integrate? does superposition hold in this case
in the non-equilibrium, infinitesimal limit? have to worry about the dielectric...

in the Brackley paper units are phi = kB T / e0



" the  E -field (and hence the potential gradient) being larger in the medium with the smaller permittivity."
right.

so:

assuming superposition.

determine constant radial electric field at R: derivative of eq. 21. 
convert to V/m. 

in the integral, figure out component of ^ field in the +z direction

divide by 80 permittivity (worst case)

surface integral over the sphere, total charge * (dA / volume) 





okay. okay.

So.  I can kind of see how, when talking about relativity

and CGS units - maybe

and if you're dealing with a numerical problem, maybe you need to re-scale by some units to fit
in the bitting of your computer.
hell mathematica gives you 200 bits of precision, but whatever, you can convince me.

but WHY did YOU HAVE TO go through this big complicated DERIVATION
with SPACE in
uits of 

THE BJERRJUM LENGTH OF THE SOLUTION?!??
what the devil

but, you know what, it's fine. AS LONG AS YOU MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY EXPLICIT what's unitless
and what's unitful! hats - on everyhing. little infoboxes and glossaries below the equations


Ooh Looookat mEee I'm going to make c=1 t=c/s and divide time by the (planck length) and nobody will call me Out on It


i'm LOOKKIIng at YOu sean Hartnoll
you think you can get away with your devilishly handsome 


wow, that analytic expression for PB really blows up as kappa is decreased
at 1/(4 nanometers ) we get just a huge mess


Hey, elmer has an option for poisson-boltzmann! cool
see https://www.nic.funet.fi/index/elmer/doc/ElmerModelsManual.pdf



Bae call this "electro-mechanical permeabilization", suggest a pipette as the converged-electric-field
cuvette (cool!), and cite a simple analytical transmembrane potential from Needham
