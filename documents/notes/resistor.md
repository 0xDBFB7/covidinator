Dear Dr. Tsushima,

Apologies for the intrusion into what is surely already a tumultuous schedule.

We have been trying to apply apparently little-known research by Yang et al[1], who describe staggering effectiveness at inactivating viruses with very low-power microwaves via a non-thermal effect (a specific envelope-disrupting acoustic resonance mode) at circa 8.4 GHz. 

The research - and the virus - has progressed to such a degree that it would seem an arrogance to continue alone. Much more detail can be provided if desired.

I realize that there are probably few people with the requisite experience twiddling their thumbs at this time, and every minute spent drains effort from more certain therapies.

Assistance from a more competent computational biologist than I would greatly accelerate the project.  

Is it possible that someone at York would be willing to assist for some time?

We have not endeavoured to obtain any funding yet - all we have to offer at the moment is joint authorship.
