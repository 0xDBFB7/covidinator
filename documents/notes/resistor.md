Man, RF resistors are super expensive - and the Vishay FC series only goes in factors of 5 and 10, so we'd need to parallel a bunch. That's no good.

> RF resistors should be approximately as wide as the microstrip trace itself

Pencil lead is a bit too conductive for the purpose - 2 ohms / cm or so. Difficult to tune, even with a file, and the resistance is pressure-sensitive.

we could use gigabeq's copper plating technique for the contacts

0.08g fine graphite + 0.055g elmer's glue (PVAc) was mixed, squished onto a glass slide. Only a small amount of the graphite was wetted by the PVAc and used - equivalent in volume to the drop, maybe 0.01g at most.

Resistance was in the Mohms.

It was then baked with 150c hot air for 1m. Formed a hard plastic layer. With sufficient contact pressure, 200 ohms could be obtained! Wonderful.

The 3-ohm resistor required for a T-type attenuator might be a bit tricky with this process. A pi-type needs a 250 ohm R.
