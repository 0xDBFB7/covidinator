friend on the vacuum hackers very quickly found a paper on viral electroporation that I hadn't seen, so it seems like I need to do a better job 
searching for references.

"enveloped virus transmembrane potential electroporation", scholar,


------"electric field "virus" sterilization electroporation enveloped", scholar

"AIR DISINFECTION PROCEDURES IN THE DENTAL OFFICE
DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC", mentions electric field, but only in passing and not cited

"Virus Inactivation in Water Using Laser-Induced Graphene Filters"
"Thus, a greater field is required for electroporation of smaller organisms like a virus as
compared to bacteria"
