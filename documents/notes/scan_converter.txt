As the sweep speed increases, however, the dot becomes dimmer; lower electron flux. 
One solution is to run the thing hotter and with a smaller dot, like microoscillographs. 

Direct electron to photographic plate is sometimes used, too.
Image intensifiers, or microchannel electron multipliers can help 
(angled holes cause collisions, secondary electrons are emitted by the dielectric and accelerated, or electron beam induced conductivity). 

The propagation speed of the beam leads to a lag; however this shouldn't be a huge issue.


Scan converters like the 7912 can form a vidicon tube. 

Modern sensors have a layer of glass right on the sensor, which seems very hard to remove.

However, old VGA sensors have a package with a glass window offset from the bare sensor die
[Servoli 2011]. Happened to have a suitable webcam.

UV eproms apparently have a "threshold" that can be measured and can be written with an e-beam
in the same way.

Broke the sensor glass by scoring with carbide pushing with thumb and removing the fragments.
putting tape over would probably have been a good idea. A few pixels are dead.

Sensor is 3.5 mm by 3 or so. 

delay lines look like a good option for triggering.


hdcs - 1020

whatever

sensor noise floor is 70 e- / pixel. pretty good.

couldn't get the first sensor to seal. destroyed it.

broke open a coby snapp camera. same sort of sensor. this time the window was held on with a
silicone elastomer. broke it, jet of 425c air melted the silicone and it came off. 
might not have even had to break it.

hey, the deflection will have to 

bloody annoying to seal this up.

FUSES! glass tubes, right diameter! just need to drill a fine hole 

got some phosphor from a broken tube. hard to keep it from vanishing.

they'll probably hold a fine vacuum, too...

use copper tube as the vacuum line.

-------------------oh, did I have the polarity right?-------------------

"Bussmann
does not offer hermetically sealed fuses for this type of
application"

doesn't seem like fuses are actually sealed...

it's pretty hard to get a seal to the sensor.

glass fuses pop pretty violently when heated with 425 c air.
just epoxy on the ends. comes off easily.

"in-vacuum ccd camera"


might be able to drive a laser with one of those ECL picosecond drivers, then operate
a photoconductive switch?

Auston switch

sipms only do a few ns
oh, no, scratch that, that's the pulse width - the rise time of a TSV spim is ~90 ps @25v!

huh, there are electron detectors on digikey AXUV20HS1


seems like Reuven's team is working on this. might want to shoot an email to let them know
about the problems

the SCAs use DB9 connectors, but actually are not EGA/CGA but VGA
just needs a pin remapping

------------------------------------

using rpi camera 

ov57

1.3 micron pixels, a few kiloelectron full well, 10-bit readout. pretty sweet sensor.

the controller board with the flat flex could be glued onto the 

other people sanded it down or cut into the back epoxy. didn't need to do that.
just used a pair of snippers to get the first pre-glass lens mount off to access the 
ir filter glass

lots of plastic on this guy. 

outside is a larger diameter piece of aluminum

drilled a slot in a 1/16" alu plate for the flat flex. 2 mm or so wide.


jb weld cures in 30 minutes if heated to 90c, apparently.
storage temp for the image sneor seems to be 70c. will do.

------------------------------------

transit time distortion is going to be an issue.

ultrasonic systems use the same scan converter tubes

pumping down through the 0.1 mm aperture is going to be a pain;
for this reason I am going to pump down from the camera side

one of the electrodes should be put to a half-way voltage by two resistor dividers

rpi zero has a different CSI connector
you can do an adaptor
dammit

OK led on old pi 1 a is dim apparently corrupt sd can do 
try fix

well, that fixed it

IF PI HANGS:
clear the dirty-bit by fsck-ing /sdc1

raspiconfig camera sets
start_x=1
gpu_mem or whatever = 128. then the board hangs.
fuyckaldfkjalsdkfj ladskj ffuck?



hey, a TDS820 oscilloscope has a rise time of 58 ps. that's pretty good?
input v range is 3v. needs a 1000:1 or 30 dB attenuator
cheap ones only do 200 watts, whereas we'll be somewhere around 20,000 watts.
in fact, I can't even find a high voltage attenuator with those kinds of specs.
what do they mean by "sampling" scope? 
tds820 is a "sampling" scope. dammit.


so indeed a capacitive divider will be needed. In any case, 30,000

put up some sheet metal to prevent computer damage 


"The Micro Channel Plate's amplification degrades irreversibly with operation, in proportion to the log of total charge passed per channel or display area. For this reason, continued operation with a steady trace and especially at large beam currents must be avoided. The 7104 contains a "limited viewing time" circuit to assist with observing this restriction."

huh!

heeey, what if we just drill a hole through the PCB for the beam
to go through and seal both sides with a viton O ring?
delrin backing to seal the O ring

A delrin fitting that bolts on

use WARP to coupled-sim with FDTD?

the region in a microstrip with a component perpendicular to the beam is 
relatively small.

designed with Replicate Layout



just use JB weld, forget O rings
jb isn't good for the pcb junction though because it's not removable...




1000 V / 0.2 mm to megavolts/m = 5 megavolts/m - definitely will need silicone between there!
even silicone will barely do it, but whatever...

use the big threaded rod

cut the alumina tube with one of the mcmaster super-thin diamond dremel wheels.
cut like butter. 2 seconds. no dust. moistened with a few drops of water.








------------------------------------------------------------

Viral absorbance sensitivity

1e3 electron charge * 10^7 V/m = 1.6 nanonewtons

0.2 N/m capsid stiffness from "tough" paper - an empty capsid will move a few nm!

10^9 * (1 microliter/ 1 ml) (titer) * 1.6 nanonewton * 1 angstrom / 100 picosecond = 1.6 milliwatts


total power is 20000 watts, so that requires vertical resolution of (something huge)

now, if the titer is increased to 10^12 by viradel, 1.6 watts. 

the charge might be even higher on t4 - no nucleocapsid to cancel out

wait but there aren't that many particles in the little region. the region is maybe 1 microliter 

make the cpwg region really long to get lots of absorption

however, will time-domain reflectometry work for this?

differential measurement? invert one signal?

will subpixel centroiding be good enough?

10^12 * (10 microliter / 1 ml) * 1.6 nanonewton * (1.6 nanonewton / 0.2 N/m) / 100 picosecond 

= 1200 watts


-------------------------------

lathed the front and backplates, milled a slot for the ribbon cable with a 1/16 end mill.
 JB welded the ribbon cable.
JB weld measured by scale on a piece of cardboard, dispensed with a broken Q tip.

broke almost every drill bit trying to drill the brass aperture.
brass is a jerk. should have used aluminum.

soldered some wires on.

JB weld-ed the tubes. Adding a little layer 2 mm away from the end and then turning
while inserting makes a really, really nice bead.

Baking at 90 C.

phased-array dispersive pulse? would that work?

#51 drill bit is for the  

---------------------------------

deflection sensitivity:

1 kev = 1e7 m/s (non-rel) 

2 mm deflection region, electron spends 0.5 ns in that space - nooope, the field is only present for 100 ps so we have to base it on that

(1 mm / 1e7 m/s) in ps = 



(100 ps * (1000 V/m * 1 electronCharge / 1 electronMass)) * (5 mm / (1e7 m/s)) -> um

8 micrometers (1 pixel)

the deflection wires need to be less than 1 mm wide 

oh wait, that's assuming we can get a 1 um dot, which isn't possible.

20 microns is more like it.

use square gold header pins.

------------------------------------


A few papers have used multiple beams or a sheet beam. not sure what advantages that provides.



ITAR h.1.a requires "a resolution of 8 bit or more and a sample rate greater than 1.3 GS/s"
so as long as we have lesss than 256 pixels we'll be fine?

add safety resistor!

get a new stepper driver

it is notable that people say "everything has a resonance frequency", when in fact most cases that ehy refer to, such as biological systems, do not becuase they are overdamped!


---------------------

put it together. Pumped down and stablized at 200 microns immediately. great stuff.

lots of vibration; put the pump on foam, that cut it down a lot, taped a wrench
to the pipe to damp even more, that helped again.

at 5 kV, arcing at the bolts used to squish the oring onto the ceramic probe.

adding a small amount of kapton didn't help. creepage along the ceramic and then the tape
the ceramic cold-cathode gun should have been made at least twice as long.

with a 1 mm deflection region, 1500v is still okay (because the freq. response goes as the velocity, 
which goes as the sqrt.). 1.5 mm is not okay.

at about 6 keV, the electron gun broke down. breifly saw some sort of glow,
burned out part of the camera. corona and breakdown seems to account for the 
white lines seen, rather than the









aaha! There was not *sufficient* pressure! 
drilled some 12l14. broke the #51 drill, switched to #52. definitely have to go slow and peck.

oh, crimp a piece of tubing in a micrometer?

---------------------------------------


at 1500 micron, a purple glow extended past the alumina 
junction. a single line of pixels, sensitive to magnetic field and 
focus coil.  at about 6 kv (beyond the half-way point on the dial), magnetically sensitive beam is found.

why only a single line?

at higher voltages, the signal seemed to get less noisy, surprisingly;
however the electron gun quickly broke down in the atmosphere part..

oh.


the camera is burned out. only one line of pixels works now, that's why.

circle on camera sensor when removed.

replaced the camera sensor. the trick to removing the glass is to cut around
the glass straight down, then shave off the plastic lip.

the replaced sensor has not obviously been degraded after a few minutes at ~5 kev.
visualizes the beam just perfectly.

before, when the pressure was < 300 microns, the gun would break down (externally, a spark)
very easily. At 1500 microns, the gun almost never breaks down at all.
anode (+ v) is the one closer to the sensor.

used a small needle valve from mcmaster (and another valve) to control the pressure. Works very well, easily controllable.

light from the cold-cathode discharge is really annoying. Lee and Haine and Jervis tilted their cc tube for this reason.

beam shimmers just like an x-ray tube. Solenoid has some effect.

shimming with a screwdriver with a magnet.

going to use a smaller aperture.

paper discusses making small apertures by poking a needle through
aluminum foil on a piece of glass.

Made a small brass insert, 1.5 mm dia with a ~1mm hole in it. soldered a piece of copper foil
over the hole. poked a plastic-head sewing needle into it onto a glass slide, making a very small aperture.
 then pushed it down the anode.

works great! very little light from the cathode discharge now.

can't believe how well this O-ring anode works! no difficulty sealing despite 5 

The anode is removable because we might want to just pop a little hole through
the board - turned out to be useful for replacing the electron gun.

The O ring is held in place with a piece of brass with a 45 deg angle made with a center drill.


no sign of RID on the sensor yet either.

some debris fell into the bore, unfortunately.

the translucency of the alumina tubing is somewhat annoying. ambient conditions need to be pretty 
dark for a good capture.


An LR44 coin cell has no trouble lighting the little 1.4V lamp (JKL Components Corp. 1728).
120 mAh - the bulb draws 60 ma, so 2 hours of life. not too bad. this means we don't need
to worry about a floating supply.

oh neat, "self biasing", "Cathode bias resistor". one fewer psu.

xpdc2 has support for background gas, but no geometry??
xoopic is good for this problem.
seem to have changed their input file structure.

Particle-In-Cell Code with Monte Carlo Collisions 

huh, warp does support collisisons. see Tegerup.

double sided pcbs make great feedthroughs!
