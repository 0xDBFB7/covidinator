As the sweep speed increases, however, the dot becomes dimmer; lower electron flux. 
One solution is to run the thing hotter and with a smaller dot, like microoscillographs. 

Direct electron to photographic plate is sometimes used, too.
Image intensifiers, or microchannel electron multipliers can help 
(angled holes cause collisions, secondary electrons are emitted by the dielectric and accelerated, or electron beam induced conductivity). 

The propagation speed of the beam leads to a lag; however this shouldn't be a huge issue.


Scan converters like the 7912 can form a vidicon tube. 

Modern sensors have a layer of glass right on the sensor, which seems very hard to remove.

However, old VGA sensors have a package with a glass window offset from the bare sensor die
[Servoli 2011]. Happened to have a suitable webcam.

UV eproms apparently have a "threshold" that can be measured and can be written with an e-beam
in the same way.

Broke the sensor glass by scoring with carbide pushing with thumb and removing the fragments.
putting tape over would probably have been a good idea. A few pixels are dead.

Sensor is 3.5 mm by 3 or so. 

delay lines look like a good option for triggering.


hdcs - 1020

whatever

sensor noise floor is 70 e- / pixel. pretty good.

couldn't get the first sensor to seal. destroyed it.

broke open a coby snapp camera. same sort of sensor. this time the window was held on with a
silicone elastomer. broke it, jet of 425c air melted the silicone and it came off. 
might not have even had to break it.

hey, the deflection will have to 

bloody annoying to seal this up.

FUSES! glass tubes, right diameter! just need to drill a fine hole 

got some phosphor from a broken tube. hard to keep it from vanishing.

they'll probably hold a fine vacuum, too...

use copper tube as the vacuum line.

-------------------oh, did I have the polarity right?-------------------

"Bussmann
does not offer hermetically sealed fuses for this type of
application"

doesn't seem like fuses are actually sealed...

it's pretty hard to get a seal to the sensor.

glass fuses pop pretty violently when heated with 425 c air.
just epoxy on the ends. comes off easily.

"in-vacuum ccd camera"


might be able to drive a laser with one of those ECL picosecond drivers, then operate
a photoconductive switch?

Auston switch

sipms only do a few ns
oh, no, scratch that, that's the pulse width - the rise time of a TSV spim is ~90 ps @25v!

huh, there are electron detectors on digikey AXUV20HS1
