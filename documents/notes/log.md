## RF Resistors

RF resistors are required for attenuators, Wilkinson power splitters, terminating striplines, and for power measurement.

The Vishay FC series appears to be the only brand specified above 6 GHz. Unfortunately, they're quite expensive and only a few values are available.

> RF resistors should be approximately as wide as the microstrip trace itself

HB1 pencil lead is a bit too conductive for the purpose, at 2 ohms / cm or so. Difficult to tune, even with a file, and the resistance is pressure-sensitive. The surface could be copper-plated with Gigabeq's plating technique.

0.08g fine graphite + 0.055g elmer's glue (PVAc) was mixed, squished onto a glass slide. Only a small amount of the graphite was wetted by the PVAc and used - equivalent in volume to the drop, maybe 0.01g at most.

Resistance was in the Mohms.

It was then baked with 150c hot air for 1m. Formed a hard plastic layer. With sufficient contact pressure, 200 ohms could be obtained! Wonderful.

The 3-ohm resistor required for a T-type attenuator might be a bit tricky with this process. A pi-type needs a 250 ohm R.

Per **Frequency Response of Thin Film Chip Resistors, Vishay** we can actually get away with stock 0603 50 ohm resistors up to 10 GHz - the impedance is off by at most 20%.
