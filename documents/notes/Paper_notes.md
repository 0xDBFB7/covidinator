"Because the frequency is determined by biological structure, trespassing on licensed frequencies is unavoidable. The non-replaceable filament will be sized such that it burns out after some 6 months of use - after the pandemic has ended. This will clear the FCC spectrum for the licensed user, who will presumably not be making particularly good use of their allocation during this time anyways." There is also likely sufficient tolerance in the inactivation frequency for spread-spectrum techniques to be applied.

Many means exist to generate RF power, including

- Gunn or IMPATT diode. Do not appear to be commonly available.

- "GaAs microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMICs)."

The author has no prior experience in microbiology, and access to a pathogenic BSL-2 virus would probably result in another pandemic. There are also difficulties in culturing, propagating and assaying such viruses. The Phi6, there is precedent for using. No Phi6 could be procured due to shipping restrictions and phage bank closures.

*Highlight implementation details (like reasons why Phi6 wasn't used) differently? Sidebars?*~~~~

T4 is not an ideal surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. T4 has a 120 nm prolate icosahedral membrane capsid directly surrounding the DNA core. SARS-CoV-2 has a 120 nm spherical lipid envelope surronding a 10 nm nucleocapsid, which surrounds the core. H3N2, as used by [],is 100 nm.

In both cases, RNA was found, so the capsid was broken.

The charge distribution and pressure within the virus also differs.

Conflicts of interest: all of them. The author could stand to gain mightily monetarily (but will not; if local production is started, the devices will be sold with global profits capped at $50,000, financials will be public at /accounting.md, and any underhanded profit-seeking misers may find themselves handily undercut), and would profit greatly if society were to fail to collapse. This has almost certainly biased the author's analyses of safety and effectiveness. Again, please consider these claims with due skepticism. Truly unconcerned parties, such as a member of an uncontacted tribe.

[1]:  First, this isn't my idea in the slightest; if anything, Yang et al should profit - but their research was publicly funded in the first place. Second, this is a vulnerable time, and everyone needs their last dollars. I'm in a middle-class family, I clearly have enough money for science already.

First, the models with a coarse mesh clearly suffer from the effects of a
too low spatial discretization (the substrate thickness is modeled with the height of only one cell).
This produces a noticeable shift in the resonance toward low frequencies.

Author Contributions is a neat section to have. Not important for this one, obvs

Funding: This research received no external funding.

Because Q varies with pH, it may be more difficult to inactivate viruses entrained in vomit, or aerosols from vomit.

The author has already [overstepped their fields], and will not attempt to produce epideemological modelling. However, an  Based on the R0 of COVID-19, herd immunity is likely to begin at approx. 25% market penetration. 

It is likely that sufficient PCB and microwave transistor capacity exists to produce a *covidinator* for every hospital bed in North America in a few weeks - on the order of 1 million units.

standard PCB production lines are not well optimized for a simple product such as this.
