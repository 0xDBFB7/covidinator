"Because the frequency is determined by biological structure, trespassing on licensed frequencies is unavoidable. The non-replaceable filament will be sized such that it burns out after some 6 months of use - after the pandemic has ended. This will clear the FCC spectrum for the licensed user, who will presumably not be making good use of their allocation during this time anyways."

Many means exist to generate RF power, including

- Gunn or IMPATT diode. Do not appear to be commonly available.

- "GaAs microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMICs)."

The author has no prior experience in microbiology, and access to a pathogenic BSL-2 virus would probably result in another pandemic. There are also difficulties in culturing, propagating and assaying such viruses. The Phi6, there is precedent for using. No Phi6 could be procured due to shipping restrictions and phage bank closures.

*Highlight implementation details (like reasons why Phi6 wasn't used) differently? Sidebars?*

T4 is not an ideal surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. T4 has a 120 nm prolate icosahedral membrane capsid directly surrounding the DNA core. SARS-CoV-2 has a 120 nm spherical lipid envelope surronding a 10 nm nucleocapsid, which surrounds the core. H3N2, as used by [],is 100 nm.

The charge distribution and pressure within the virus also differs.
