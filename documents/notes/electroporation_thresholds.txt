Previous studies [3,6] showed that the effects of such ultrashort pulses on cells could not be described in terms of classical electroporation. 

Single 60 ns, 2.6 MV/m caused cell membrane permabilization. 10 ns 6.5 MV/m did not.

10 ns, 6.5 MV/m 

A single 10 ns, 65 kV/cm electrical pulse,
which had no effect on plasma membrane integrity
(Fig. 2), caused the nucleus in an AO-stained HL-60 cell
to become irregularly shaped

This is in line with the analysis of SCHOENBACH 2004, where pulses shorter than 25 ns are expected to produce a greater field strength


Romeo 2017 cites Shoenbach 2008's circuital model, which is apparently a good fit for
nanosecond pulses. Cool!

For a membrane with a relative dielectric constant of 8, the
electric field in the membrane is ten times higher than the
electric field in the adjacent cytoplasm, which has a dielectric
constant of 80. The electric field then acts directly on membrane
proteins, rather than causing charging of the membrane, and, if
sufficiently strong, can cause direct and instant conformational
changes, such as voltage gating.


we need a conductivity. Hughes 2001 find, using a multi-shell model, for Herpes,
protein capsid thickness 15 nm
core:

Schnelle 1996 find, with a single sphere model, (closer to Brackley)
18 nm shell thickness
core:

Gimsa 1999 find for Influenza:
18 nm shell thickness

(note that some use milliseiemens per cm!)

sucrose increases eR by a small amount - to 3 or so.

Benz,

Bilayers are varactors. 

At low voltages the specific capacity of the membranes from
oxidized cholesterol/n-decane is 555 nF/cm^2.
tau for simple bilayer is about 70 to 600 ns.
