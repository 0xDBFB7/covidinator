 Indeed, experiments on cells have demonstrated that the
application of 20 pulses as short as 50 ns can induce electrofusion
[146]. 


Chen, Leukemic2004 

Previous studies [3,6] showed that the effects of such ultrashort pulses on cells could not be described in terms of classical electroporation. 

Single 60 ns, 2.6 MV/m caused cell membrane permabilization. 10 ns 6.5 MV/m did not.

10 ns, 6.5 MV/m 

A single 10 ns, 65 kV/cm electrical pulse,
which had no effect on plasma membrane integrity
(Fig. 2), caused the nucleus in an AO-stained HL-60 cell
to become irregularly shaped

This is in line with the analysis of SCHOENBACH 2004, where pulses shorter than 25 ns are expected to produce a greater field strength

Gimsa 1994 have a section "Measurement of the internal conductivity" with an interesting 
protocol for leaking ions and conductivities.


Romeo 2017 cites Shoenbach 2008's circuital model, which is apparently a good fit for
nanosecond pulses. Cool!

For a membrane with a relative dielectric constant of 8, the
electric field in the membrane is ten times higher than the
electric field in the adjacent cytoplasm, which has a dielectric
constant of 80. The electric field then acts directly on membrane
proteins, rather than causing charging of the membrane, and, if
sufficiently strong, can cause direct and instant conformational
changes, such as voltage gating.


we need a conductivity. Hughes 2001 find, using a multi-shell model, for Herpes,
protein capsid thickness 15 nm
media: (5 mS/m hughes 1998)
core:
30 mS/m 
er 30
shell:
<not given>
er 60



Schnelle 1996 find, with a single sphere model, (closer to Brackley)
18 nm shell thickness
media: variously, 3 mS/m to 74 mS/m 
core:
0.8 mS/m (1250 ohm-meter)
permettivity 3

Gimsa 1999 find for Influenza:
18 nm shell thickness
media: 6.5 and 74 mS/m
core:
0.1 mS/m (two orders off from hughes!) (10000 Ω·m)

Ermolina on tobacco mosaic:

most notably: "TMV has a pI of 3.5 and contains a large
number of acidic groups." - very different from info or SARS.

Green thesis, TMV, 16 mS/v conductivity: 
0.15 or 0.085 S/m 

"TMV virions are unenveloped and can be considered to be a solid protein object with a
given surface charge density. The high value of the particle conductivity is therefore likely to
arise from the counterions associated with the surface charge moving along the surface as well as
charges moving inside the particle. As mentioned previously, the different labelling procedures
result in a different surface charge distribution which could account for the difference in the
conductivity values for the two types of TMV. "

Touw on Alfalfa virus find 
a dielectric relaxation time of 600 ns. 



The FEM electret modelling paper Javidpour 2020:
"We assume that there are no salt ions
inside the lipid envelope, but that the envelope is completely permeable to them"

shell: 

er 4 (direct conflict with the experimental results!)



Ting 2011 (donnan)

"As usual, the small ions, which
can diffuse freely, maintain charge neutrality subject to equality of chemical potential for each of the small ion species across the
viral capsid"
Here's an interesting thing: if the ion mobility was sufficiently low, the *osmotic pressure*
could still be balanced as usual but still agree with conductivity results?

Gimsa 1994 says *regarding membranes not core*,
"Membrane conductivity, in general, cannot be independent of the intracellular ion concentration."





Chan 1997, liposomes, ~30% similar er between inside and outside,
10^-6 S/m

(note that some use milliseiemens per cm!)

sucrose increases eR by a small amount - to 3 or so.

Benz,

Bilayers are varactors. 

At low voltages the specific capacity of the membranes from
oxidized cholesterol/n-decane is 555 nF/cm^2.
tau for simple bilayer is about 70 to 600 ns.

Letter1974


put resistors in parallel

simulate a small virus membrane segment - two on top of each other
membrane proteins stuck in there
monitor membrane field
modulate inside conductivity
there's a lot of small stuff stuck in the membrane that will modulate the
permittivity


pulser, 50 picofarads * 200000 ohms = 10 us time constant

might want to add more resistors in parallel to speed up?

though the pulser was only tested to 10 khz in the Li study

sea water is 5 S/m, tap about 50 mS/m, and distilled about 0.1 uS/m

There's a "stern surface conductance" that I don't know about yet. Nakano 
measure adenoviruses but only report this surface conductance.

Ermolina find for CPMV and TMV (table 1) that conductivity is about 50 to 100 mS/m, 
agreeing with the HSV-1 results. (Both are non-enveloped)

Sharifipour actually test electroporation of HIV and find that 2.3 MV/m 
"disclosed significantly reduced infectivity of
electroporatically transformed HIV viruses compared to
untransformed HIV viruses"

Got an awesome email back from Gimsa. He replied with Dielectric1994,
says to look at Schwan's data Dielectric1966. Specifically he says it's the low *water* content.
Does he mean ion content or water content? The water can't be relevant. 

Brackley cite Siber 2012, who cite ref 78, a permittivity of proteins of 5.

T4 is impermeable and the osmotic strength in the capsid is set by the.


Should really make a table with all this stuff

oh man, I don't know if I want to cite the sharifipour

talked to Ryan

Oh wow cell sizes vary much more than the 6 um paper I cited, 
so the long time constants in that one paper are also reasonable

write an equation to optimize waveform to get max transmembrane ratio?

Gabriel table 1, dielectric properties of tissues:
tau 2 ranges from 560 ns (liver) to 6 ns (tendon). tau3 ranges from 22 to 159 us
helpfully, conductivity values are also given:
the alphas are very low, indicating a very broad distribution of relaxation times.

Kotnik is the right tool to use
