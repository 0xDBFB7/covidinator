 Indeed, experiments on cells have demonstrated that the
application of 20 pulses as short as 50 ns can induce electrofusion
[146]. 


Chen, Leukemic2004 

Previous studies [3,6] showed that the effects of such ultrashort pulses on cells could not be described in terms of classical electroporation. 

Single 60 ns, 2.6 MV/m caused cell membrane permabilization. 10 ns 6.5 MV/m did not.

10 ns, 6.5 MV/m 

A single 10 ns, 65 kV/cm electrical pulse,
which had no effect on plasma membrane integrity
(Fig. 2), caused the nucleus in an AO-stained HL-60 cell
to become irregularly shaped

This is in line with the analysis of SCHOENBACH 2004, where pulses shorter than 25 ns are expected to produce a greater field strength

Gimsa 1994 have a section "Measurement of the internal conductivity" with an interesting 
protocol for leaking ions and conductivities.


Romeo 2017 cites Shoenbach 2008's circuital model, which is apparently a good fit for
nanosecond pulses. Cool!

For a membrane with a relative dielectric constant of 8, the
electric field in the membrane is ten times higher than the
electric field in the adjacent cytoplasm, which has a dielectric
constant of 80. The electric field then acts directly on membrane
proteins, rather than causing charging of the membrane, and, if
sufficiently strong, can cause direct and instant conformational
changes, such as voltage gating.


we need a conductivity. Hughes 2001 find, using a multi-shell model, for Herpes,
protein capsid thickness 15 nm
media: (5 mS/m hughes 1998)
core:
30 mS/m 
er 30
shell:
<not given>
er 60



Schnelle 1996 find, with a single sphere model, (closer to Brackley)
18 nm shell thickness
media: variously, 3 mS/m to 74 mS/m 
core:
0.8 mS/m (1250 ohm-meter)
permettivity 3
shell:



Gimsa 1999 find for Influenza:
18 nm shell thickness
media: 6.5 and 74 mS/m
core:
0.1 mS/m (two orders off from hughes!) (10000 Ω·m)
er 30
shell:
0.1 uS/m
er 80

Ermolina on tobacco mosaic:

core:

most notably: "TMV has a pI of 3.5 and contains a large
number of acidic groups." - very different from info or SARS.

Green thesis, TMV, 16 mS/v conductivity: 
0.15 or 0.085 S/m 

"TMV virions are unenveloped and can be considered to be a solid protein object with a
given surface charge density. The high value of the particle conductivity is therefore likely to
arise from the counterions associated with the surface charge moving along the surface as well as
charges moving inside the particle. As mentioned previously, the different labelling procedures
result in a different surface charge distribution which could account for the difference in the
conductivity values for the two types of TMV. "

Touw on Alfalfa virus find 
a dielectric relaxation time of 600 ns. 



The FEM electret modelling paper Javidpour 2020:
"We assume that there are no salt ions
inside the lipid envelope, but that the envelope is completely permeable to them"

shell: 

er 4 (direct conflict with the experimental results!)



Ting 2011 (donnan)

"As usual, the small ions, which
can diffuse freely, maintain charge neutrality subject to equality of chemical potential for each of the small ion species across the
viral capsid"
Here's an interesting thing: if the ion mobility was sufficiently low, the *osmotic pressure*
could still be balanced as usual but still agree with conductivity results?

Gimsa 1994 says *regarding membranes not core*,
"Membrane conductivity, in general, cannot be independent of the intracellular ion concentration."





Chan 1997, liposomes, ~30% similar er between inside and outside,

sucrose increases eR by a small amount - to 3 or so.

Benz,

Bilayers are varactors. 

At low voltages the specific capacity of the membranes from
oxidized cholesterol/n-decane is 555 nF/cm^2.
tau for simple bilayer is about 70 to 600 ns.

Letter1974


put resistors in parallel

simulate a small virus membrane segment - two on top of each other
membrane proteins stuck in there
monitor membrane field
modulate inside conductivity
there's a lot of small stuff stuck in the membrane that will modulate the
permittivity


pulser, 50 picofarads * 200000 ohms = 10 us time constant

might want to add more resistors in parallel to speed up?

though the pulser was only tested to 10 khz in the Li study

sea water is 5 S/m, tap about 50 mS/m, and distilled about 0.1 uS/m

There's a "stern surface conductance" that I don't know about yet. Nakano 
measure adenoviruses but only report this surface conductance.

Ermolina find for CPMV and TMV (table 1) that conductivity is about 50 to 100 mS/m, 
agreeing with the HSV-1 results. (Both are non-enveloped)

Sharifipour actually test electroporation of HIV and find that 2.3 MV/m 
"disclosed significantly reduced infectivity of
electroporatically transformed HIV viruses compared to
untransformed HIV viruses"

Got an awesome email back from Gimsa. He replied with Dielectric1994,
says to look at Schwan's data Dielectric1966. Specifically he says it's the low *water* content.
Does he mean ion content or water content? The water can't be relevant. 

Brackley cite Siber 2012, who cite ref 78, a permittivity of proteins of 5.

T4 is impermeable and the osmotic strength in the capsid is set by the.


Should really make a table with all this stuff

oh man, I don't know if I want to cite the sharifipour

talked to Ryan

Oh wow cell sizes vary much more than the 6 um paper I cited, 
so the long time constants in that one paper are also reasonable

write an equation to optimize waveform to get max transmembrane ratio?

Gabriel table 1, dielectric properties of tissues:
tau 2 ranges from 560 ns (liver) to 6 ns (tendon). tau3 ranges from 22 to 159 us
helpfully, conductivity values are also given:
the alphas are very low, indicating a very broad distribution of relaxation times.

Kotnik is the right tool to use

Electroinsertion

The conference proc. book with Schwan, dielectrop. and ..., 
provides an expression for the time constant of the peak spectrum (see that Alfalfa paper).

actually, the step response given by kotnik is already good enough for arbitrary waveforms using the 
technique described by Matt L 
pretty sure it's identical to the green's function method 
indeed it is!

(otherwise known as a convolution integral)

it should be possible to evaluate that integral (of Kotnik's unit steps)? 

apparently we can either integrate step response * derivative of Ef[],
or integrate impulse response (derivative of step response) * Ef[] 
(might be easier to do variational calc on that)

NOTE: Mathematica does not handle UnitStep the same as HeavisideTheta;
the derivative of one is Indeterminate, while the other is DiracDelta!

neither the step or impulse response integrals seem to have closed-form solutions.
can we exchange the integration order for the second integral over the energy?


Only need to integrate from 0 to t if h and Ef are both 0 for t < 0


the direct integral of the impulse*Ef[] over tau or t  is very unwieldy - really huge.

hang on a minute, if Fourier can convolve accurately, can we
 just do the same fourier transform lagrange trick 
to convolve?
haphazardly optimizing pulse duration/spacing using kotnik's technique is not obviously effective. 

https://class.ece.uw.edu/235dl/EE235/Project/lesson17/lesson17.html
"We've just shown that the Fourier Transform of the convolution of two functions is simply the product of the Fourier Transforms of the functions. This means that for linear, time-invariant systems, where the input/output relationship is described by a convolution, you can avoid convolution by using Fourier Transforms. This is a very powerful result."

the indefinite power integral of 

note how the order of the fdtd step mattered
note how the order of the fdtd step mattered

optimizing the total power ratio  of host_cell over virus seems to work okay
using a power cost function for the ratio (sum(e^2 )) doesn't really work
beacause it puts oscillatory power to make the average 0

when plotting the step responses, it seems like there's a weird glitch on the virus
it goes up linearly 

ooh, side effect of constraining the pulse energy to one, bipolar pulses don't work
oops

return ((- virus_output) + (abs(tstop - np.linalg.norm(convolve_output(input, host_cell, dt) * 1e6)))) 
just makes 


how about bang-bang control?
doing bang-bang over the ratio of virus to host doesn't seem to work
doing based on the slope might work maybe?


so based on these parameters, we would expect a 
20e-6/50e-9 1/400 ratio in the steady state. Indeed, this is exactly what we see.


However, with a short sub-nanosecond pulse, I actually can get 1/6.8 with a virus membrane er=80,
despite the time constants being less than 20% different

host_cell = Cell(0.3, 80, 0.3, 80, 1e-7, 5, 20e-6, 5e-9, t)
virus = Cell(0.3, 80, 0.005, 30, 1e-8, 80, 50e-9, 14e-9, t)
Host cell 4.4455226913733625e-07, 2.361165949232313e-09
virus 3.7644303303652596e-07, 3.460238575701499e-09

with a virus membrane Er of 5 rather than 80, the ratio improves to 1/2.7!!!
with 80 and dropping the host cell size from 20 to 2.5 um, 

changing the virus core permittivity to 5 rather than 30 has a very small impact.
same with 80 rather than 30.
same with the conductivity? hmm, that's messed up...
changing the virus membrane to 5 nm and er 5 still doesn't break it.
it really is just a size thing? somehow?
need some way of displaying the multivariate variation with all the variables



so there are apparently two different ways to solve these optimal control problems 
(and just doing it like this is not one of them.); indirect, using the variational calculus, 
and 'direct', using numerical methods.  Lots of these are proprietary or MATLAB;
the paper on gekko has a good review of programs for this purpose.

might want to convert the step response into a DE somehow, since most solvers want the differential 
eq form
(actually it looks like it'll be easier to go from the laplace transform to the DE:
https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Representations/SysRepTransformations/TF2SDE.html )

Schaum's outline of differential equations has a whole section on convolutions and the unit step

gekko seems to require conversion of the high-order ODE to a single-order DE by substitution.


interesting thing from gekko docs:

"The traditional method for max value (max) is not continuously differentiable 
and can cause a gradient-based optimizer to fail to converge:...

"The traditional method for absolute value (abs) has a point that is not continuously differentiable at an argument value of zero and can cause a gradient-based optimizer to fail to converge:"

gekko might not be great because it seems to somewhat revolve around a uniform timestep
psopt includes 'pseudospectral' stuff, might work better

should use PACE to do the image thing


gekko allows direct state-space input!

well, simulating the DE with gekko in mode 4 
works great when the end time is greater than 1 microsecond, but 
I think we're hitting precision limits (might need to scale) 
is  the background APmonitor thing in float or double?

PSOPT has automatic scaling.

oh hey, both gekko and psopt use ipopt internaly.

not sure if adol was compiled with sparse enabled - it used the apt adol version,
anyhow we'll try

gekko keeps playing with my heart - keeps optimizing at 1e-20 whatever and everything' sjust numerical
noise
