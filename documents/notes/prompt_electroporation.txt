Setup similar to to TEM air lasers. Very simple 

Gap will be 0.635 mm (the capillary).

Silicone oil permittivity is about 3. Water permittivity is about 

Then add a vivaldi?

Silicone oil breaks down at 10-20 kv/mm.

3 mm gap, 0.0025 m^2, 22 pF.

>>> 0.5 * (electricConstant * ((50 mm)^2) / 3 mm * 3.0) * (10000 volts)^2 -> J

  0.5 × electricConstant × ((50 mm)^2 / 3 mm) × 3 × (10000 V)^2 ➞ J

   = 0.00110677 J

not a whole lot of energy! The TEM lasers use 


if AC coupled, pulse width can be varied with argon pressure?

a 2 mil PTFE foil should do it.

The nucleus of human cells is huge, we don't need to worry about that!



Zeppenwolf

can lathe custom holders

Oh ho ho! Pressurized spark gaps are ITAR restricted!

Jobava has eq 2, 

run bacteria through to isolate some kind of effect?



Two layers of the 1/2" Kapton (<0.15 mm) can do 10 kv.  

Man, there are these papers fr

A 5 to 1 pulse generator to spark gap 




Built a spark gap using machinist's parallels. Not smooth enough, surprisingly; 
preferentially goes across certain spots.

this might be an issue with this "linear" design. while it offers a low inductance, 

conversation with Mason and Applied Ion. Good stuff.

there are transient digitizers, see Sandia document, which can do this sort of measurement.

the scan conversion tube, or the Fletcher micro oscillograph, seem like extremely valuable
devices that have been partially lost to time. 10-ghz  recording?

seem like extremely simple devices, really. 



the jitter of spark gaps means it's hard to make a sampling oscilloscope!


the planar spark gap, ~0.25 mm, poorly aligned single stage already gets us a 5 ns falling edge! 

that's pretty cool!

so-called "peaking switch" or "sharpening switch"



Ceramic NLTLs need very large voltages to exhibit the effect. is 10 kv enough?

10% sulfuric acid apparently can strip oxides off copper pipe. good for the inside I guess.


there are a few RF transistors on digikey that might be effective...

can we 


undoped silicon auston switches look pretty simple to build. just need a fast megawatt laser...


oh man Li et al have really done it - a marx PFL like the other paper, except with a
Diodes Inc fast avalanche transistor






----------------------------------------

Li use a FMMT417TDCT-ND‎avalanche transistor
what's the difference between an avalanche transistor and a diode?

not many transistors are designed for avalanche use apparently 

Liu Jinuan 



-------------------------------------------

suspended microstrip; 2 plates

there are two different avalanche breakdown modes

old version of 'svg'. downloaded svg.dtx, ran 'tex svg.dtx', 
copy .sty s to ~/texmf/tex/latex/local

Protocols.io is pretty great. Going to use it from now on.
has an export to json feature, that's important

The electric ﬁeld within the gap is homogeneousfor an electrode thickness that is on the order of the gapdistance or larger. If the electrode thickness becomessmall compared to the gap distance, the ﬁeld becomesincreasingly inhomogeneous, in extreme cases with agreatly varying ﬁeld strength across the gap.

1 oz copper is ~35µm

"For a 40 mm thickla ye rit r eaches only 64% ofthe nom-inalvalue of100 kV/cm in the center of the gap. Moreover, the elec-tric field is not homogeneous but shows a strong variation of up to30% (4 0 mm thickglue layer) from the center of the gapto the elec-trodes. For thin glue layers, field enhancement at the edges canlead tolocalized field strengthsinexcessof100 kV/cm."

on, 30% isn't bad.

can we use FR4 on microstrip? what's the dispersion like?

using wcalc, 

1.6 mm fr4, dipersion is about 10 picoseconds / centimeter at 1 vs 100 ghz. That's not a huge concern??
loss is 5 dB/cm at 100 GHz. that's 0.3x voltage every cm.

We'll need the reflection stubs to be about 100 ps long, or somewhere around .

metallization losses seem to be really low - it's the loss tangent that's the killer.
loss is essentially independent of 

teflon is about 1 dB. polycarbonate seems terrible.  polyproplene, however, seems to be okay!



kin depth is about 0.2 


first stage shortens the pulse, second stage reflects it?
