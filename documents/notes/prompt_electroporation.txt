Setup similar to to TEM air lasers. Very simple 

Gap will be 0.635 mm (the capillary).

Silicone oil permittivity is about 3. Water permittivity is about 

Then add a vivaldi?

Silicone oil breaks down at 10-20 kv/mm.

3 mm gap, 0.0025 m^2, 22 pF.

>>> 0.5 * (electricConstant * ((50 mm)^2) / 3 mm * 3.0) * (10000 volts)^2 -> J

  0.5 × electricConstant × ((50 mm)^2 / 3 mm) × 3 × (10000 V)^2 ➞ J

   = 0.00110677 J

not a whole lot of energy! The TEM lasers use
