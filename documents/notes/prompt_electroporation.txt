Setup similar to to TEM air lasers. Very simple 

Gap will be 0.635 mm (the capillary).

Silicone oil permittivity is about 3. Water permittivity is about 

Then add a vivaldi?

Silicone oil breaks down at 10-20 kv/mm.

3 mm gap, 0.0025 m^2, 22 pF.

>>> 0.5 * (electricConstant * ((50 mm)^2) / 3 mm * 3.0) * (10000 volts)^2 -> J

  0.5 × electricConstant × ((50 mm)^2 / 3 mm) × 3 × (10000 V)^2 ➞ J

   = 0.00110677 J

not a whole lot of energy! The TEM lasers use 


if AC coupled, pulse width can be varied with argon pressure?

a 2 mil PTFE foil should do it.

Oh ho ho! Pressurized spark gaps are ITAR restricted!

Jobava has eq 2, 

run bacteria through to isolate some kind of effect?



Two layers of the 1/2" Kapton (<0.15 mm) can do 10 kv.  

Man, there are these papers fr

A 5 to 1 pulse generator to spark gap 




Built a spark gap using machinist's parallels. Not smooth enough, surprisingly; 
preferentially goes across certain spots.

this might be an issue with this "linear" design. while it offers a low inductance, 

conversation with Mason and Applied Ion. Good stuff.

there are transient digitizers, see Sandia document, which can do this sort of measurement.

the scan conversion tube, or the Fletcher micro oscillograph, seem like extremely valuable
devices that have been partially lost to time. 10-ghz  recording?

seem like extremely simple devices, really. 



the jitter of spark gaps means it's hard to make a sampling oscilloscope!


the planar spark gap, ~0.25 mm, poorly aligned single stage already gets us a 5 ns falling edge! 

that's pretty cool!

so-called "peaking switch" or "sharpening switch"



Ceramic NLTLs need very large voltages to exhibit the effect. is 10 kv enough?

10% sulfuric acid apparently can strip oxides off copper pipe. good for the inside I guess.


there are a few RF transistors on digikey that might be effective...

can we 


undoped silicon auston switches look pretty simple to build. just need a fast megawatt laser...


oh man Li et al have really done it - a marx PFL like the other paper, except with a
Diodes Inc fast avalanche transistor






----------------------------------------

Li use a FMMT417TDCT-ND‎avalanche transistor
what's the difference between an avalanche transistor and a diode?

not many transistors are designed for avalanche use apparently

there are two different avalanche breakdown modes

Protocols.io is pretty great. Going to use it from now on.
has an export to json feature, that's important

The electric ﬁeld within the gap is homogeneousfor an electrode thickness that is on the order of the gapdistance or larger. If the electrode thickness becomessmall compared to the gap distance, the ﬁeld becomesincreasingly inhomogeneous, in extreme cases with agreatly varying ﬁeld strength across the gap.

1 oz copper is ~35µm

"For a 40 mm thickla ye rit r eaches only 64% ofthe nom-inalvalue of100 kV/cm in the center of the gap. Moreover, the elec-tric field is not homogeneous but shows a strong variation of up to30% (4 0 mm thickglue layer) from the center of the gapto the elec-trodes. For thin glue layers, field enhancement at the edges canlead tolocalized field strengthsinexcessof100 kV/cm."

on, 30% isn't bad.

can we use FR4 on microstrip? what's the dispersion like?

using wcalc, 

1.6 mm fr4, dipersion is about 10 picoseconds / centimeter at 1 vs 100 ghz. That's not a huge concern??
loss is 5 dB/cm at 100 GHz. that's 0.3x voltage every cm.

We'll need the reflection stubs to be about 100 ps long, or somewhere around .

metallization losses seem to be really low - it's the loss tangent that's the killer.
loss is essentially independent of 

teflon is about 1 dB. polycarbonate seems terrible.  polyproplene, however, seems to be okay!



skin depth is about 0.2 


first stage shortens the pulse, second stage reflects it?












10 ns * 20000 watts = 0.0002 J.
50 pF * 15 = 750 pF
0.5 * 750 picofarads * (1000 volts)^2 = 0.000375 J
0.1 mm ^2 * 5 mm = 0.5 microliters.

(0.0002 J) / (0.5 microliters * (water density) * 4.2 J/(g K)) = 0.09 C

even 100 pulses will only do a 10 C rise.

neat!




bought some skived PTFE sheets from Mcmaster as the substrate. no issues with 
bonding of the acrylic adhesive on the copper foil tape; sticks really well.

permittivity of ptfe is 2.1. not a significant effect on trace width - 3.6 mm rather than 3.
Flatness leaves much to be desired. probably needs to be screwed onto some metallic ground plane.


doing some simulations of the wave shaper with QUCS.


2 1 mm deflection plates. 200v across them. no deflection. magnetic-field sensitive, but
no deflection. 
huh.

maybe things aren't aligned right and we're seeing secondary electrons or something?

otherwise we might need to port the discharge tube and 

probably need a new electron gun that's more tightly machined and with a tap-off
to vary the pressure.
the tight fit of the alumina bores is really great.


put a magnet in the cold cathode - pre-focus
no, von ardenne says that doesn't work for slow, low-voltage tubes. Wehnelt is better.
improvements to be made:

longer gap, and pre-anode focus coil
tighter tolerances on the critical bore



switch to making the board? diagnostics are not strictly necessary?



it seems like it should work without a leak - 50 microns should be sufficient pressure?
maybe try again at a much lower pressure

otherwise drill a tiny hole in the cathode maybe?


on 1.6 mm PTFE, 43.14 picoseconds per centimeter.
actually, the PTFE is closer to 1.7. same difference.

ptfe trace width is actually 5.33 mm. 

ooh, slotline looks prefect! unfortunately, impedance is variable with frequency.
Mariani has a good diagram on how to couple coax to slotline - it's not like you'd expect.



I have a few small filament bulbs. might work - a few advangates: can use lower pressure, doesn't need a 
leak in the electron gun - electrostatic deflection will work better

have a "behaviour and performance" section for each piece of equipment.






okay, so with the simulation results in mind (namely, that 0.5V on the line leads to 400 V/m 
in the fluidic channel), we can only expect about 300 kV/m with the current channel.
oh dear! taking a layer of the fluid away to prevent conduction currents,
we get only 200 V/m! darn!

oh! fix the conductivity

also a significant phase shift, meaning the wave properties aren't going to be reproduced
accurately. darnit!


RPi is used so that the ethernet isolation provides a bit of protection against the EMP and the 10kv
supplies - so that I don't fry my precious computer if a wire comes off!


using the coax cable on the trigger pulse mainly for jitter and stability



add to readme.md:

 * Some musings on a cheap (~$300) 20+ GHz 0.5+ terasample/s von Ardenne-like scan-conversion digitizing probe. Only a few situations in which this would be useful because of the really low sensitivity of von Ardenne-like plates. 
    - I'm a little wary of working further and publishing any details on this because most detailed descriptions of 10+ GHz transient digitizers since the 1970s are classified (despite being well-described in the public domain since the 1940s!).
    - On the other hand, work on TDS is maybe limited by labs not having access to an affordable picosecond digitizer, so maybe it warrants some attention.



oh man, there's so much going on with lipid 

effective permittivity


Jackson, Electrodynamics has some stuff on forces 



PyGBe has a sphere mesher.  doesn't do dielectrics tho
mathematica has the Laplacian[] thing, which supports spherical coordinates and works pretty well
