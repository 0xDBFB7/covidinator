Setup similar to to TEM air lasers. Very simple 

Gap will be 0.635 mm (the capillary).

Silicone oil permittivity is about 3. Water permittivity is about 

Then add a vivaldi?

Silicone oil breaks down at 10-20 kv/mm.

3 mm gap, 0.0025 m^2, 22 pF.

>>> 0.5 * (electricConstant * ((50 mm)^2) / 3 mm * 3.0) * (10000 volts)^2 -> J

  0.5 × electricConstant × ((50 mm)^2 / 3 mm) × 3 × (10000 V)^2 ➞ J

   = 0.00110677 J

not a whole lot of energy! The TEM lasers use 


if AC coupled, pulse width can be varied with argon pressure?

a 2 mil PTFE foil should do it.

The nucleus of human cells is huge, we don't need to worry about that!



Zeppenwolf

Oh ho ho! Pressurized spark gaps are ITAR restricted!

Jobava has eq 2, 

run bacteria through to isolate some kind of effect?



Two layers of the 1/2" Kapton (<0.15 mm) can do 10 kv.  

Man, there are these papers fr

A 5 to 1 pulse generator to spark gap 




Built a spark gap using machinist's parallels. Not smooth enough, surprisingly; 
preferentially goes across certain spots.

this might be an issue with this "linear" design. while it offers a low inductance, 

conversation with Mason and Applied Ion. Good stuff.

there are transient digitizers, see Sandia document, which can do this sort of measurement.

the scan conversion tube, or the Fletcher micro oscillograph, seem like extremely valuable
devices that have been partially lost to time. 10-ghz  recording?

seem like extremely simple devices, really. 



the jitter of spark gaps means it's hard to make a sampling oscilloscope!


the planar spark gap, ~0.25 mm, poorly aligned single stage already gets us a 5 ns falling edge! 

that's pretty cool!

so-called "peaking switch" or "sharpening switch"



Ceramic NLTLs need very large voltages to exhibit the effect. is 10 kv enough?

10% sulfuric acid apparently can strip oxides off copper pipe. good for the inside I guess.


there are a few RF transistors on digikey that might be effective...

can we 


undoped silicon auston switches look pretty simple to build. just need a fast megawatt laser...
