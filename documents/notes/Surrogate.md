> COVID-19 is most often spread from person to person among close contacts.

Masks aren't perfect, so might be some use-case there

Are there 'deactivated' viruses equivalent to K12-strain bacteria, so as to test measures? You can't shoot what you can't see. 

Presumably not, though, since even within coronaviruses we see differing properties, so we couldn't get an accurate assessment.

Ah yes, there are, viral surrogates - see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670103005188 - all the useful stocks are probably in rare supply, and we don't want to muck up the works.

The family Coronaviridae is divided into 3 groups. Groups I and II include human, mammalian, and avian coronaviruses, and group III consists of avian coronaviruses.

Feline coronavirus is an accepted surrogate.

Storage Conditions    Frozen: -80°C or colder
Freeze-Dried: 2°C to 8°C
Live Culture: See Propagation Section

<blockquote>Virus or phage cultures require host cells in which to multiply. For bacteriophages, cultures are grown by infecting bacterial cells. The phage can then be isolated from the resulting plaques in a lawn of bacteria on a plate. ... A bacteriophage is any one of a number of viruses that infect bacteria.</blockquote>

These seem pretty safe. standard biosafety concerns apply

T7 is 55 nm, roughly on par with COVID, with a diameter of approximately 60–140 nm. Wide variance. Bacteria don't get smaller than 200nm generally, so not useful for RF testing.

E-coli is 600-1000 nm.

SARS-CoV-2 and its surrogate (HCoV-229E), which is a Containment Level 2 (CL-2) pathogen. The aptamer-based sensors can rapidly (<3 minutes) and specifically bind to the virus proteins with a measurable color/fluorescence change. In addition, AptaGO-based a low-cost (<$1 per test) platform while being ultrasensitive (protein equivalent of <100 virions), thus making them ideal for the proposed use.

There are non-PCR phage existence tests.

"Spot testing, in which a small volume of phage is placed on a growing lawn of bacteria, is perhaps the most common way of determining whether the phage is able to infect. While simple and rapid, this technique can sometimes cause false positives because of lysis of bacterial cells without phage infection." https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5014875/

Bacteriophage Isolation Protocols

Isolating phage can be a fairly simple process and for the most part researchers accomplish it in a very similar manner to that used by the earliest phage biologists (d’Hérelle and Smith, 1926; De Groat, 1927). The basic method is to obtain an

 The only bacteriophages known to have a lipid envelope around their protein capsids are the members of the Cystoviridae family [6]

oops - since the envelope is kind of the important part.

So you can take environmental phages and hosts, kill the hosts? add a whole bunch of the desired host, wait, kill the hosts again, centrifuge, to isolate the desired phage. P. syringae pv. Phaseolicola HB10Y is an enveloped host, Phi6 phage. Wants a sucrose broth

Phages are easier to deactivate than the actual viruses https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ees.2014.0496

BVD virus is often used for enveloped tests but is a BSL2.

Testing for phage damage seems pretty easy: see Table 1. Methods for detecting newly isolated bacteriophages.

Oh! Take leaf with P. syringe. Culture. Separate phages. Do again, kill phages with vit. C.

https://ampd.yorku.ca/profile/joel-ong/ this dude did an art project with guttman labs u of t with P. Syringae. Emailed. 

You can follow Laboratory Guide for Identification of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria, Third Edition Edited by N.W. Schaad, J.B. Jones, and W. Chun.APS PRESS 2001. Besides selective media, you can use King's  B agar.  Pseudomonas syringae cause leaf spots on plants mostly after cold nights (0-5oC). The lesions can be colonized by other bacteria at higher temperature, especially by Pantoea agglomerans.

Phi 6 has a tetrahedral shape, probably similar to COVID. A few other phages have membranes, but 

Oh apparently Phi6 being a good surrogate is common knowledge.

Influenza A has a totally different spectrum - absorption peak at 12 or so ghz https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yi_Jan_Chen/publication/237374252_Microwave_resonant_absorption_of_viruses_through_dipolar_coupling_with_confined_acoustic_vibrations/links/0f3175397b4bc5e940000000.pdf

One key difference between the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle is that the lysogenic cycle does not lyse the host cell straight away.[2] Phages that replicate only via the lytic cycle are known as virulent phages while phages that replicate using both lytic and lysogenic cycles are known as temperate phages.[1]

Lytic sounds like an easier fit for fast testing.

Use X Y stage with antenna and eppendorfs to scan parameters

Fan on dust mask 

Dry air? 

Heat gun to sterilize tip - then tip can be stainless steel

Why is a bunsen used to produce an asceptic field? It seems like a fan and a hepa filter would fulfill the same purpose.

New England has "Freezer Programs", where internet-connected freezers are connected to their online ordering thing and distributed around the country! Neat.

There are "phage banks" distributed about; the one in Canada has closed, but DESZ is still open for now.

Found someone else also looking for Phi6 on a phage database.

We're kind of down to the wire now. Germany is closing their borders, fedex might stop shipping, etc...and DESZ only accepts first orders via fax.

Phages seem to be covered by Material Transfer Agreements - legal contracts that prevent sharing of organisms. oops

The Korean phage bank's email address verification is not working.

Okay, forget this. We'll just use e. coli and a T phage.

To avoid possible existing viral RNA in solution before the microwave illumi-
nation, we pretreated the virus samples by adding RNase to degrade the existing RNA outside the viral particles.

Siphoviridae can be isolated from raw milk.

"Virulent bacteriophages (e.g., T4) multiply rapidly after infecting a host cell and destroy the cell through lysis.  Temperate bacteriophages (e.g., lambda) may lyse the host cell or lysogenize the host." https://www.uwyo.edu/virtual_edge/lab11/bacteriophage.htm

“Phagehunting” is the process of
isolation, characterization, and genomic analyses of phages that infect
bacterial hosts 

I wanna be a phagehunter!

"We will now filter the solution to remove bacteria. Obtain a sterile 0.45 m filter, a syringe,
and a sterile tube. Do not open the filter package yet." - neat, you can use a filter instead of a centrifuge.

The most important test we have to run is how long exposure must continue for.

"The medium used in phage plaque assays has a relatively low percentage of agar and therefore is called soft agar; it permits diffusion of phage to nearby uninfected cells but does not permit new phages to move to remote parts of the plate. "

The phi X174 coliphage looks more similar to, but is only 25 nm.

's interesting: the resonant frequency of K12 seems to be in the 50+ ghz range, whereas one would expect it to be lower as the size increases.

Air is not going to be an issue - attenuation only starts getting significant at ~12 ghz.

If this effect was caused by DNA damage, then we could look up the 

Some BSL1 virii are still pathogenic to animals, and may still require export licenses.

 binding to the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) was blocked using a zwitterionic envelope, 
what the f?

"From the literature 24 , force with 400 pN applied
on the AFM tip can fracture the lipid envelope [ of influenza ] ."
