So by measuring the *curve* of the thermal pulse attenuation along a transmission line in the solution,
essentially all issues could be subtracted.

Probably the flourescence tone could be modulated onto this, too.

white-light interferometry has apparently been used for this along

Verdet constant temperature shift? Nah, too small.

32khz crystals can be made to oscillate in solution.

Ah! Use a bunch of quartz oscillators as a temperature probe!

Beat two oscillators - diode mixer

oh wait, that's not really ideal. We need to measure the shift locked into the sawtooth;
a slow integrating method like that probably isn't great?

A tuning-fork crystal has the advantage of being non-metallic.

50 ppm over 80c on 20 MHz = only a few counts per second over temp.

IT must be remembered that heat won't diffuse over these short timescales.

use those little tungsten wires?
