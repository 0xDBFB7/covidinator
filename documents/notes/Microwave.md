RF! Just enough power at the right freq. to bake aerosols without harming people

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11434-014-0171-3

2.4Ghz isnt's that effective - you need 500w direct for reasonable sterilization.

Is there a more specific property of viruses we can target?

Huh! 

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7771944

8 GHz tuned to virus resonant freq.

Droplet size from a sneeze might be a different, though.

Somewhat specific position - beamforming to direct at cough? That makes everything way more complex.

Exceeds specific  

https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18030
In this article, we show that SRET from microwave to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public.

while the RNA genome was not degraded by the microwave illumination, supporting the fact that our studied SRET mechanism is fundamentally different from the microwave thermal heating effect.

HackRF only goes to 6ghz - downconverter? maybe borrow spect at York

Use IR and phone camera to find aerosol droplets and destroy?

Also need to test if tissue cells are affected

Oh wait, wavelength of 8ghz microwave is like 4 cm, so no phased array antenna required probably.

Because of the wide variation in sizes, freq. sweep probably required

TODO look up size distribution of coronaviruses

strapped to chest to maintain proper alignment with face? What if you sneeze to the left or right, that won't work

On clavicle?

mounted to goggles?


Infineon SiGe can do 10 dB at 10 GHz.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drwGvATLNaw - QUCS and copper foil


what about a second harmonic?


They say 25 mW/cm^2, 3 watts for their system. If we have a 2x2 cm antenna, we'll only need about 0.1 W to hit that.

HB100 10 Ghz outputs at 10 dBm, or 10 milliwatts, which isn't quite enough.

conductive surfaces might be an issue.

It's hard to get this much power in the X band. Gunn or avalanche diodes aren't commonly available, RF amps with P1dB 20 dBm are >$20.

only

There are 2w triode oscillators

bought mixer and 4ghz synth from Amazon, from downconverter - wrong package, will have to modify

Optical Hetrodyning was once used to determine absorption spectrum

Nitinol to physically change phase

Phased array. Sum two elements to get phase; servo high-side p-channel to change varactor voltage and frequency slightly

PLL-like servo technique

So, if we servo the phase using a PLL,

Relative permittivity = dielectric constant. https://www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/dielectric-constants-strengths.htm varies from ~5 for aluminosilicate to 10 for alumina.

There's a sim of flu lipid envelope: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150208152758.htm
http://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/membrane.bilayer

Charmm has a vibration module. 


"In this work, microwaves were applied to excite the dipolar resonance of the whole virus structure. By exciting the dipolar mode of the nanosphere, core and shell with opposite charge distributions would move in opposite directions and will resonate like a damped mass-spring system"

So it seems like there's definitely no way this would transfer to non-enveloped phages. 

.pdb files are available for many phages. Got a license for CHARMM.

Holy crap these bio people have things figured out! Documentation, everything is so much better than plasma physics

We're trying to figure out the normal modes - vibrational frequencies - 

"Normal Mode Analysis follows the notion that although the Cartesian
coordinate system is very useful it may not be the natural coordinate
system for the molecule. There may be a different coordinate system in
which the description of the molecular motion will be far simpler. This
other coordinate system is the system of normal modes. Thus, what
'normal mode analysis' actually does is to transform the coordinate system
from the regular Cartesian set to a normal set, which is more natural to
the molecule. "
"Among the various properties that can be studied are:
1) Vibrational Spectrum - the collection of all normal frequencies. This
spectrum is comparable to experimental vibrational spectra taken
with IR spectroscopy" - fantastic.



Ah and now my lack of bio knowlee hits. Exporting a model via CHARMMing web interface, and I get: * You need to decide on the protonation states of all residues. Either they were assigned default values, or PROPKA could not be run on this molecule.

Charmming seems to be down.

This is interesting: because I was unable to simply buy my way out of the problem (by buying phi6), I had to learn more about simulation, and produce a better product. Neat!

T4 head is 111 Ñ… 78 nm (similar to )

Interference with weather radar

second harmonic may decrease prices further.

use footnotes rather than endnotes

check FCC sar methods

No adverse effects have been established
from low-level exposures despite 70 years
of research
No known interaction mechanisms
No meaningful dose-response relationship 

It's interesting that these things don't apply to viruses.

angle test tubes, cap up, so dust doesn't fall on them

switch polarization, phase, etc at specific points in the resonance to enhance the effect? Switching will have to be very fast...

Will need 4ghz high pass image-rejection before mixer

"coarsened" elastic network model, which is analogous to an adaptive mesh-refined 

Completely coincidentally, the NE3210S01 fet that "Small Size X band" used is almost exactly the same as the CE3520K3 fet I bought. Also:
"A schematic diagram of the AIA is shown in Fig. 1. The antenna is comprised of two wide transmission line sections connected by a narrow linewidth section. The narrow linewidth section serves to form a transmission feedback loop, and the two wider sections radiate the radio frequency (RF) signal."


Copper Oxide + charcoal definitely works, just need to try CuO+.

We'll need HackRF <-> mixer, synth <-> mixer <-> filter, filter <-> antenna.

HackRF max input power is only 316 microwatts. That's tiny. Attenuator that I've got (I thinik CATTEN-0200) is only good to 3 Ghz anyhow.

We want to precisely measure the power. How on earth can we can level losses at 10 GHz? We don't have a reference 10 GHz generator.

Thick film resistors are good for RF. Graphite, specifically.

I suppose we don't actually need a precise power measurement. We can set the level to just above where a 15 minute exposure is sufficient to kill everything (thereby setting the 10 dBm reference from Yang et al), and then try shorter and shorter exposures.

PDB has a great list of software. https://www.cellmicrocosmos.org/index.php/cm2-project into ProDy looks good.

Used QUCS's attenuator synthesizer to make an attenuator. Great success! 30 DB:
"46.9347 Ohm"
"3.16544 Ohm"
"46.9347 Ohm"


The strength and Q of viruses changes significantly with pH. Neat!


Tried qspectrumanalyzer. Upgraded hackrf firmware. hackrf-spectrum-analyzer works pretty well.

Hey, having a direct WiFi AP on the main server to a notebook laptop would be great.

Trying to get this adf4351 board running to test the downconverter. Had it lock once, but then not...

Made a simple Nichrome pancake element with ~6" of wire. Got to about 600C on a firebrick. 

First, university.

For QC testing, just filter, rectify ("demodulate") and measure average power through resistor?

Was orignally planning on using ProDy with the lipid generator, GROMACS looks equally good though, has an easy electric field module

http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/How-tos/Normal_Mode_Analysis

What with the multitude of fields we're working in here, workspace is getting a bit cluttered. Going to try Awesome. 

We could use two beams of 4 GHz 90 deg out of phase, or four beams at 2 GHz; or perhaps two 24 GHz ISM band beams beating at 8.4 GHz? 



Tapered anode: electrode deflects to shorten path and alter phase?



Feedback: we don't want to use LEDs, since we don't have a PnP step yet. 



A fermi estimation: given global WiFi shipments of 3 Bil/yr globally, and assuming that every such device uses a single suitable RF transistor (a gross overestimation, since most use multifunctional ICs), producing 100 million units in 2 weeks would consume the entire global production capacity, assuming that other lines aren't re-tooled and disregarding the effect of the virus on production lines.

This would be a logistical nightmare.

There are nearly 1 million staffed hospital beds in the US alone.

100 parallel production lines doing 1 every 10 minutes in 500 factories to make 100 mil. in 2 weeks. Not bad! A large last-mile team to distribute the elements in time would be required, though people would probably line up themselves.

Consider a bus full of people all with these devices. SAR limits could be exceeded? Some sort of feedback during non-transmitting times - if received power exceeds some amount, don't transmit.

Laser thermal crosslinking with benzoate?

Conformal coat
tin or nickel plate with thiourea
Epoxy pot? That'd take too long. Dip in a non-corrosive latex paint?

**Just simple masked screen-printing would be useful**

How do you laser-trim caps?

OpenEMS - use to sim triode

"Formier getter - aluminum magnesium alloy"

" Pieces of
thin nickel foil are used between each ceramic and
titanium part to form a reactive alloy."* 

MLI'd tungsten heater 

The triode is really very simple indeed - just look at where the grid is!

A tiny drop of glass can be put over a port on the thing and then fired in a vacuum.


Jackpot! paper added. Grid v=60v. 

Tubes could be fired under low-vac and then gettered down?

Now this is an application for IBSimu.

Tungsten wire from lightbulb factories - except, thoriated? Also, incandescent lightbulbs aren't produced en masse anymore.

Oh! the anode voltage can be varied, perhaps - changes electron velocity in drift? Or a second phase-shift grid.

Okay. Picture a 2d planar triode. Amazing, right? The lid can be a seperate plate of alumina, with a little channel filled with active-metal (or silica, even better!) that's coated afterward. Just a little nichrome heater that follows the silica seal bead in a low-vac chamber.

The filaments are sized to tolerate 3 months of continuous operation. 

Side chamber with magnesium getter, electrodes come out and are flashed

A typical smartphone has maybe 10 watt-hours. We want, say, a 6-hour life, with the phone on standby. At the spec'd 5% eff, the tube will take 0.8 W to put out 0.04 w. Perfect! will need a USB passthrough of some sort.

voltage on USB C is similar to those of old; just resistors on pins.

looks like USB C ports on phones can push about 1.5 amps out. That's not bad!

Oh, and we probably won't need continuous service.

This is kind of an america-centric idea, where we all have modern phones with USB C PD. I don't know how we could replicate this in places where handheld batteries aren't common - phillipines has only a 30% smartphone pop. Solar? 1

If we use laser masking and pasting, each trace can have a seperate mask, applied in sequence after drying so we don't have issues with impossible isolated areas.

How do we get the copper to the side of the triode? do we even need to? it could be produced roughly planar.

Let's see. We want...0.1 watts, at 48 volts (step-up?). That's 0.002 A of electron current. Via the C-L law, we'll need 

SAR exemption limits are around 50 mW

Angle low-temp soldered 

Ceramic USB ports - all different types integrated - C, A, B, etc - top of plug planar with PCB.

The 8 GHz bands have a few painful allocations, like *"Aeronautical radionavigation"* (ouch!) and *"Maritime radionavigation"* (ouch!)

Cumulatively, DigiKey has about 30 million N-channel mosfets in stock, so we're okay using a single mosfet for a charge pump.

A 10-minute, 100-lane factory will produce 200,000 units in 2 weeks. If each board consumes 2 mm of tungsten wire, that's just 400 m of wire. Each roll is about 100 to 500 m - that shouldn't be a big deal. Midwest Tungsten has rolls of 1500 m. Still would be easier to use nichrome, though.

MEEP is also good, but apparently less suited to RF designs.
OpenEMS has python bindings.

Oh, the PVOH photosensitize thing won't work with a carbothermal method - the carbon black will probably absorb all the UV! A multilayer technique might work

Should try laser patterning CuO+graphite though. Nice black surface. Not sure if it'll scale, though - 100 laser diodes per factory?

"Flaming" the rim of a test tube heats it, creating a local updraft. 

Use permeable sponge or something for acetone toner transfer.



Looks like this describes the optical hetrodyning technique: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bem.2250040104

Seems like opinion is divided on DNA having resonance modes. These guys
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bip.360330114 say there's no resonance modes, the other says there's a significant mode.


"1400 and below" describes using Cu2O, copper (i) oxide, not CuO. Similar melting and boiling points.

Remember to record the Alumina particle size.
