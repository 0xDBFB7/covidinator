Copper Oxide + graphite definitely works.

Polyethylene is attacked by ethyl acetate, so we can't demold 
Polyprop. is inert to the same.

A 1 oz shot glass is about 100 g of alumina. 


"Films from three different bloom strength were prepared and dried at three different temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C) to investigate whether the differences in ordering and aggregation during film formation, under controlled drying conditions, reflect changes in their mechanical properties. Results showed that Young's modulus (E) was not significantly (p ≤ 0.05) influenced by the drying regime because it remained around 3.0 GPa. "

Gelatin can be freeze-dried; this preserves the shape as the water leaves by sublimation.

"In argon, pyrolysis is less efficient and the gelatin leaves an ash residue of
30 wt.% relative to the original binder content."

Talk about ball-milling

Glutinious rice flour is distinct from regular rice flour. Great option otherwise!

The glucose-derived binder only has a strength of 1,22 ± 0,16.

Glycerin is a neat solvent for some things - crosslinks xanthan gum.

Enzume urease changes the bonding of gelatin. Good results.

Glutaraldehyde isn't actually all that bad. 

The prorosity introduced by freeze-casting can be alleviated via glycerol. Might be helpful for freeze-drying.

The difference in strength between 3 and 4 % GRF is negligible. "Acrylic acid-2-acrylamido-2-methypropane sulfonic acid
copolymer (AA-AMPS, Taihe Water Treatment Co.,
Ltd., Shandong, China) was used as dispersant."
Starch is insoluble in ethanol.

They say "dried in an oven with specific temperature and humidity conditions", but don't say what those conditions are! 

We should do a thermogravimetric analysis of the drying of GRF.

PEG1000 is very hygroscopic and rapidly dries ceramics. Different percentages are used to vary the drying rate.

A box with a glass window could be used to laser-pattern copper oxide. Something to try.

Could also screen-print traces - with PVOH?
