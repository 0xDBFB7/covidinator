# Procedure

#### Disposal of copper etchant

Had some old HCL+peroxide solution that I wanted to get rid of. The peroxide hair bleach used contained castor oil, which produced this really annoying foam (presumably hydrogen-filled). Adding small amounts of bicarbonate solution helped, as did the addition of some silicone oil.  

Put steel wool in both. One had already been neutralized by bicarbonate, and most of the copper had already precipitated out. 

*The other coated the steel wool with a brilliant copper coating in about 10 minutes.* Something to remember - that's an electroless copper on steel

Coffee filter completely ineffective at filtering the precipitate.

*The other solution which had plated the copper was then neutralized. 
It produced a brown precipitate, presumably an iron salt from the steel wool.
You can also precipitate the copper out pretty easily, apparently.


Says about 100 mg can be disposed of daily - if I etched 10 cm^2, that's 300 mg. 

"Copper(II) chloride salts, of course, make bright blue solutions. As noted in the wiki article, CuCl2 turns greenish with excess chloride."

"You don't want to put this down the drain. The allowable limits for copper in drinking water in BC are 500 µg/L fairly high, but for disposal the levels are frequently at the "wildlife levels", 3 µg/L." 

tried boiling down the solutions with the hotplate. Very slow. Just put it in a jug for later dispoal.
