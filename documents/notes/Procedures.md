#### Disposal of copper etchant

Had some old HCL+peroxide solution that I wanted to get rid of. The peroxide hair bleach used contained castor oil, which produced this really annoying foam (presumably hydrogen-filled). Adding small amounts of bicarbonate solution helped, as did the addition of some silicone oil.  

Put steel wool in both. One had already been neutralized by bicarbonate, and most of the copper had already precipitated out. 

*The other coated the steel wool with a brilliant copper coating in about 10 minutes.* Something to remember - that's an electroless copper on steel

Coffee filter completely ineffective at filtering the precipitate.

*The other solution which had plated the copper was then neutralized. 
It produced a brown precipitate, presumably an iron salt from the steel wool.
You can also precipitate the copper out pretty easily, apparently.

Says about 100 mg can be disposed of daily - if I etched 10 cm^2, that's 300 mg. 

"Copper(II) chloride salts, of course, make bright blue solutions. As noted in the wiki article, CuCl2 turns greenish with excess chloride."

"You don't want to put this down the drain. The allowable limits for copper in drinking water in BC are 500 µg/L fairly high, but for disposal the levels are frequently at the "wildlife levels", 3 µg/L." 

tried boiling down the solutions with the hotplate. Very slow. Just put it in a jug for later dispoal.

#### Insulator

Printed the element insulator mold with a very fine infill - just 15%. Infill basically didn't print. Min. feature is 1.5 mm. Top surface has some imperfections.

Going to use the following blend:

| **Medium-temp aluminosilicate trial 1** | **Kaolin** | **TiO2** | **CuO** | **MgO** | **Gelatine** | **Al2O3** | **Total solids** |
|:---------------------------------------:|:----------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|

For reference, I have 580g of Al2O3 left.

Melting will be at 40c. 

Each insulator slot in the mold is 1.33 mm x $6.6\pm0.15$ mm x 4.49 deep. The cavity is 72.42 mm x 69.36 mm. 

Measure each quantity in seperate containers.
Make sure hands and utensils are dry
Certain types of mixing bowls seem to be particularly prone to electrostatic charging, making it difficult to weigh small quantities.

Water temp. 20.4 C.

39 wt% water was almost enough. After melting at ~45 C, however, the solution dried just slightly, and was difficult to pour.

An extra 15% was added. As the added liquid was cold, it almost immediately gelated.

Re-melted at ~50c. Pretty viscous, brute-forced it into the mold by tapping etc.
After about an hour, thin droplets from pouring had dried to reasonable strength.

AFter about two hours, the concoction was as strong as jello.

I think 4% gelatine was too much. 2.5% or 3% would have decreased the viscosity further.

Also, the PE tray melted. A glass beaker must be used.

#### Copper Oxide reduction test 1

Some amount of CuO, C and PVAc were mixed and fired on alumina. After some difficulty the concoction glowed a dull red. It seemed that after the mixture cooled it immediately re-oxidized. Need an inert atmosphere.

#### Microwave drying of gelatine

Bubbled as one would expect, useless.

# Starting the culture

#### 1

Autoclave:

- 10 pipettes
- Aluminum foil
- 2 shot glasses, alu foil on top.

#### 2

Pour 15 mL sterile broth into one empty shot glass.

#### 3

Autoclave for 20 minutes:

- 10 pipettes

- 1 shot glass of broth, capped with loose-fitting aluminum foil.

#### 4

Allow to cool naturally rather than venting; apparently that's useful.

- 5 centrifuge tubes.

##### 5

Flame inoculating loop.

Open bottle of host by flame. Drag loop across agar. Insert into shot glass.

Incubate at 37 C with . After (12 h?) a 

#### Culture: take 1

Complete failure. Opened the pipettes from the wrong end, they fell to the table. The delrin washers I was planning on using to keep the Eppendorfs slightly open were too fiddly, and I put all sorts of fingerprints at the opening of the tubes. Opened the sterile broth away from the Bunsen - I should have poured it into a seperate beaker first, so as to not contaminate the existing solution, but I didn't. 

Proper racking is important too.

Leaving the tubes open while autoclaving is the recommended procedure, but there's so much condensation with this pressure cooker, that probably won't be possible. They're half-full of condensate when removed! The condensate drying step is really pretty important.



Instead, I just filled with 1ml of broth and put them in the cooker closed. 



Wet-lab bio stuff is *hard*.

#### culture: take 2

All the tubes except the controls had opened during autoclaving. Closed them immediately. They didn't gather all that much condensation.



Sharpie Labels stayed on, that's convenient.

Went really well - just a simple inoculation this time. Inoculated P0 to E2 in order. Put in the incubator, lids closed. 

Finished at 4:47. 4 hours later we need to put in the phage.

Stirring at 450; i > 200, 30, every 120 seconds, at 35 C.
