"Ethanol and air passed over silver catalysts at 550—570°Cgive 50—55% conversion per pass to acetaldehyde with an 85% yield. This process is also operated with a rich mixture of
ethanol and air, although it is rarely used commercially because there are more economical ways of making acetaldehyde. Isopropanol gives acetone, and other higher
alcohols also react over silver and copper catalysts,but catalytic dehydrogenation is
ordinarily used instead of oxidation"

Probably don't want to use ethanol.

Put a bit of copper oxide in one of those pyrex funnels, pumped in some butane, and lit the end -  a wonderful fireball is produced. Used a second butane torch to heat the powder. CuO turned red hot, not quite self-sustaining - probably didn't have sufficient gas flow, but the oxide was definitely reduced to copper. Not sintered, either, but that's also a temperature effect.

The whole thing could be gas-fired with propane or natural gas. Just racks of
