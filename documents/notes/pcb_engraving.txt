Bit from McMaster-Carr, International Tools 62-1095

30 deg, 0.381 mm tip radius. 

HMC220B pitch is 0.65 mm center-to-center. Used 0.22 mm cutter radius in flatcam.



Used sharpest "old" engraving bit in tray for trial.

7 mm probe spacing, (16 points for downconverter board).

300 mm / min feed, 24Krpm spindle, depth -0.1 mm, Zhigh=3, overlap 0.05? mm. Tool dia in "paint area" 
set to 0.22 mm, tool dia in "cnc job" set to 0.38.

Beautiful result.

Had to run through a invert_probing.sh to fix a few syntax issues.
