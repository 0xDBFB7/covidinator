Bit from McMaster-Carr, International Tools 62-1095

30 deg, 0.381 mm tip radius. 

HMC220B pitch is 0.65 mm center-to-center. Used 0.22 mm cutter radius in flatcam.



Used sharpest "old" engraving bit in tray for trial.

7 mm probe spacing, (16 points for downconverter board).

300 mm / min feed, 24Krpm spindle, depth -0.1 mm, Zhigh=3, overlap 0.05? mm. Tool dia in "paint area" 
set to 0.22 mm, tool dia in "cnc job" set to 0.38.

Use Kicad's aux axis to position the board in FlatCAM.

Beautiful result.

Had to run through a invert_probing.sh to fix a few syntax issues.



---------------

A run with the MG chemicals substrate was a bit messier. Either the step-over was too small, 
or perhaps the cutter diameter was set too large? Some regions were grooved, rather than removed.

Tried the new toaster oven; seemed like the temperature ramp was too slow, the board seemed to get 
a bit overheated. oven probably needed preheating.


0.17 mm tool diameter setting is even better.

Man, this tool is still going strong after 15+ boards!








---------------------------------

make sure X-axis is the long axis.
Export gerber. Check use aux. axis.


conda deactivate
cd Programs/flatcam/
flatcam

(if you get a "can't open defaults" error, delete .FlatCam defaults.json)
application settings, set to mm and restart.

Import gerber.
non-copper regions -> generate geometry


"Paint area". 
tool dia 0.17 
overlap 0.05

---------FOR 1/32"----------

1/32" bit works well at 79% of 300 mm/min. 0.05 mm step down okay at that speed
on 1.7 mm fr4, some deflection 
slightly lower, 0.08 perhaps, might be better at higher speed because of pcb deflection

0.79 mm tool dia , 0.15 mm overlap, 24krpm
