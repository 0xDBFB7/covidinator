Bit from McMaster-Carr, International Tools 62-1095

30 deg, 0.381 mm tip radius. 

HMC220B pitch is 0.65 mm center-to-center. Used 0.22 mm cutter radius in flatcam.



Used sharpest "old" engraving bit in tray for trial.

7 mm probe spacing, (16 points for downconverter board).

300 mm / min feed, 24Krpm spindle, depth -0.1 mm, Zhigh=3, overlap 0.05? mm. Tool dia in "paint area" 
set to 0.22 mm, tool dia in "cnc job" set to 0.38.

Use Kicad's aux axis to position the board in FlatCAM.

Beautiful result.

Had to run through a invert_probing.sh to fix a few syntax issues.



---------------

A run with the MG chemicals substrate was a bit messier. Either the step-over was too small, 
or perhaps the cutter diameter was set too large? Some regions were grooved, rather than removed.

Tried the new toaster oven; seemed like the temperature ramp was too slow, the board seemed to get 
a bit overheated. oven probably needed preheating.
