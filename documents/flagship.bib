The known biological effects and hazards have been demonstrated to be largely thermal in nature. This paper reviews key developments in experimental and theoretical dosimetry, as well as confirmed biological effects that have formed the basis of ever more sophisticated human-exposure standards generated through the IEEE consensus process.

The natural frequencies of such resonances will, generally, be in the microwave frequency range. Some of these systems will be coupled to the electromagnetic field by the charge distributions they carry, thus admitting the possibility that microwave exposures may generate physiological effects in man and other species. However, such microwave excitable resonances are expected to be strongly damped by interaction with their aqueous biological environment. Although those dissipation mechanisms have been studied, the limitations on energy transfers that follow from the limited coupling of these resonances to the electromagnetic field have not generally been considered. We show that this coupling must generally be very small and thus the absorbed energy is so strongly limited that such resonances cannot affect biology significantly even if the systems are much less strongly damped than expected from basic dissipation models.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental features of phased arrays is the ability to focus the propagating waves to a specific point within the load material by inducing a parabolic time delay. This required focusing time delay has been modified from the current formulation to incorporate either an odd or even number of elements. A brief procedure leading to the derivation of the pressure distribution for beam focusing is described, which gives rise to an unclosed form. Consequently, a numerical method is desirable for the analysis of beam focusing. Using this approach, beam directivity and pressure distributions are studied to predict the behavior of focusing as compared to steering. This shows a benefit of focusing over steering within the near field of the array, and that the directivity of focusing converges to that of steering in the far field.},

Rectal temperatures before and after exposure were measured on days 1, 6 and 12. Measurements made on day 1 were treated with caution because of heterogeneity in rectal temperatures taken before exposure between the groups of mice given different treatments. On days 6 and 12, rectal temperatures rose by approximately 1\textdegree C in mice sham exposed, or exposed to 1 W m-2 or 100 W m-2. Only in the group of mice exposed to 400 W m-2 was the mean rise in rectal temperature during exposure (about 3\textdegree C) significantly increased above the sham value. In groups killed 2\textendash 3 days after treatment (mainly meiotic exposure) frequencies of chromosome aberrations in spermatocytes showed no significant heterogeneity although the highest frequency of 1{$\cdot$}5 per cent was at the highest (400 W m-2 power density. Another group killed 30 days after 100 W m-2 exposures (spermatogonial sampling) showed no significant increase over controls in chromosome aberration frequency. There was a small but significant increase in sperm count with increasing power density in mice killed 12\textendash 13 days after exposure, but a non-significant one in those exposed as spermatogonia (killed 41 days later). Thus effects were markedly less severe than those reported previously by Manikowska-Czerska et al. (1985) with a very similar radiation regime and were probably caused by the temperature enhancement.},

An infinitesimal current element (ICE) is used to illustrate the validation of added source modeling and to study the errors involved with modeling an infinitesimal element within the finite-sized FDTD grid. This model is also used to illustrate the behavior of radiation boundary conditions as their near-field position with respect to the source is varied. We characterize the errors due to modeling and boundary conditions and give guidelines for obtaining acceptable accuracy in simulations.},

We also show that the second-order interaction, which affects the third-order nonlinearity, becomes insensitive to low-frequency input termination as the DC current increases. Finally, the method of removing the low-frequency trap is presented. The fabricated LNA in 0.35-mum SiGe BiCMOS process showed NF of 0.9 dB with 16-dB power gain and IIP3 of +11 dBm with current consumption of 10 mA from 2.8-V power supply at 900 MHz. The demonstrated LNA satisfies stringent sensitivity and linearity requirement of code-division multiple-access (CDMA) applications quite well.},

We investigated possible genotoxic effects of HPPP EMF (8.8 GHz, 180 ns pulse width, peak power 65 kW, repetition rate 50 Hz) on erythrocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis. We used the alkaline comet assay, which is a highly sensitive method to assess DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile lesions. Blood samples were exposed to HPPP EMF for 40 min in rectangular wave guide. The specific absorption rate (SAR) calculated from temperature kinetics was about 1.6 kW/kg (peak SAR was about 300 MW/kg). The temperature rise in the blood samples at steady state was 3.5 {$\pm$} 0.1 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. The data show that the increase in DNA damage after exposure of erythrocytes to HPPP EMF was induced by the rise in temperature in the exposed cell suspension. This was confirmed in experiments in which cells were incubated for 40 min under the corresponding temperature conditions. The results allow us to conclude that HPPP EMF-exposure at the given modality did not cause any a-thermal genotoxic effect on frog erythrocytes in vitro.},

The antenna consists of a rectangular microstrip patch peripherally loaded with a single GaAs MESFET. The microstrip patch acts as both the radiating element and the optimal FET drain load impedance required for oscillator synthesis. The active patch element operates as a series feedback oscillator and the microstrip patch is resonated in its fundamental mode. An NEC 71084 packaged FET is used as the active device in the patch element which itself is constructed on RT-Duroid 5880 material. The element has a free running frequency of 9.625 GHz (at 3 V) and exhibits excellent electrical characteristics. Experimental results are presented for the frequency pushing characteristics of the element which are nearly linear. The active element is capable of producing an output power level of 8mW with 10\% efficiency at 2.3 V, and has an external Q factor of 32.},

The circuit processes the BPM electrode signals independently, converting the short beam pulses into slowly varying signals which can be digitized with high resolution ADCs operating in the kHz range or even measured with a DC voltmeter. For signals with peak amplitudes larger than some hundred mV the non-linear forward voltage of the diodes is compensated by a simple network using signals from two peak detectors, one with a single and the second with two diodes in series. This contribution presents results obtained with the first prototype in the laboratory and with the CERN-SPS beam.

  abstract = {Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.
Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.

This chapter discusses the basic features of different types of analog modulation including amplitude, single-sideband, frequency, and phase modulation and basic types of digital modulation such as amplitude shift keying, frequency shift keying, phase shift keying, or pulse code modulation and their variations. The principle of operations and various schematics of the modulators for different modulation schemes including Class-S modulator for pulse-width modulation are described. Finally, the concept of time and frequency division multiplexing is introduced, as well as brief description of different multiple access techniques is given. digital modulation; multiaccess communication},

  abstract = {Recently, composite materials with nonlinear dielectric or resistive properties performed well in electric field homogenization and space charge suppression in a high voltage transmission and distribution system. For the purpose of obtaining insulation materials with desirable dielectric and electrical resistance properties, we investigated several fillers with nonlinear electrical properties doped in silicon rubber composites, and their dependency on the temperature and field. The samples of silicone rubber composites with different components were prepared using barium strontium titanate (BST) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as the filler, and high temperature vulcanized silicone rubber (SiR) as the matrix. The investigations revealed that the BST-doped samples showed different dielectric properties compared to ZnO-doped composites, with an increase in the electric field, which was nonlinear. The resistivity of both doped samples was similar. Results demonstrated that it was possible to achieve higher values of permittivity, and lower values of tan{$\delta$} and resistivity, with respect to unfilled silicone rubber composites over a wide electrical field and temperature range. Discussion of the results attributes these important functional behaviours to the spontaneous polarization of nonlinear nanoparticles and the interaction between the SiR chains and the nonlinear nanoparticles at the interfacial area.},

The grid drain-source bias voltage is 7.4V and the total drain current for the grid is 6.0A, resulting in an overall dc-to-rf efficiency of 23\%. The pattern of the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio was measured and found to be essentially independent of the radiation angle. The average SSB noise level was -87 dBc/Hz at an offset of 150 kHz from the carrier. An average improvement in the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio of 5 dB was measured for a 100-transistor grid compared to a 16-transistor grid.},

Effective penetration of a few cm may be achieved with external applicators whilst small coaxial or cylindrical devices can induce localized heating in sites accessible to catheters or to direct invasion. To heat deep tissue sites in general, systems of greater complexity involving a number of applicators with particular phase relationships between them are required. The problems of thermometry in the presence of electromagnetic fields fall outside the scope of this article. Their solution, however, is no less important to the future of clinical hyperthermia than the development of heating techniques. Finally, it should be remembered that physiological parameters such as blood flow have appreciable effects in determining the efficacy of the physical techniques described above.},

Taylor tapers give low sidelobes but high forelobes and aftlobes, plus a modest gain degradation. Inverse tapers give low forelobes and aftlobes but high sidelobes and large gain degradation. Uniform excitation gives comparable axial and transverse subsidiary lobes, and is probably the best choice. Focal shift, where the peak axial power density occurs between the aperture and the phase (geometric) focus, due to the1/R\^2factor, is accurately calculated for a uniform square aperture. Since peak axial power density available from a focused aperture depends only on aperture size in wavelengths and on distance, these focal shift results allow system trade-offs to be made.},

Human epidemiological studies gave evidence of increased risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma. RF radiation was classified as Group 2B, a possible human carcinogen. Further epidemiological, animal and mechanistic studies have strengthened the association. In spite of this, in most countries little or nothing has been done to reduce exposure and educate people on health hazards from RF radiation. On the contrary ambient levels have increased. In 2014 the WHO launched a draft of a Monograph on RF fields and health for public comments. It turned out that five of the six members of the Core Group in charge of the draft are affiliated with International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an industry loyal NGO, and thus have a serious conflict of interest. Just as by ICNIRP, evaluation of non-thermal biological effects from RF radiation are dismissed as scientific evidence of adverse health effects in the Monograph. This has provoked many comments sent to the WHO. However, at a meeting on March 3, 2017 at the WHO Geneva office it was stated that the WHO has no intention to change the Core Group.},

The combined properties of the fluid and the elastomeric substrate result in a flexible and durable antenna that is well suited for conformal antenna applications. Injecting the metal into microfluidic channels provides a simple way to define the shape of the liquid, which is stabilized mechanically by a thin oxide skin that forms spontaneously on its surface. This approach has proven sufficient for forming simple, single layer antenna geometries, such as dipoles. More complex fluidic antennas, particularly those featuring large, co-planar sheet-like geometries, require additional design considerations to achieve the desired shape of the metal. Here, a multi-layer patch antenna is fabricated using specially designed serpentine channels that take advantage of the unique rheological properties of the liquid metal alloy. The flexibility of the resulting antennas is demonstrated and the antenna parameters are characterized through simulation and measurement in both the relaxed and flexed states.},

  abstract = {Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are used to enable a number of modern devices, including mobile telecommunications infrastructure and phones, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. As radiofrequency EMFs at sufficiently high power levels can adversely affect health, ICNIRP published Guidelines in 1998 for human exposure to time-varying EMFs up to 300 GHz, which included the radiofrequency EMF spectrum. Since that time, there has been a considerable body of science further addressing the relation between radiofrequency EMFs and adverse health outcomes, as well as significant developments in the technologies that use radiofrequency EMFs. Accordingly, ICNIRP has updated the radiofrequency EMF part of the 1998 Guidelines. This document presents these revised Guidelines, which provide protection for humans from exposure to EMFs from 100 kHz to 300 GHz.},

To reach watt-level output power from a single-chip CMOS PA, two main strategies can be identified: use of high supply voltage, and use of matching and power combination. High supply voltage limits are closely related to device design in the fabrication process. However, the maximum operating voltage can be improved by amplifier class selection, circuit solutions, and process modifications or mask changes. High output power can also be reached by the use of on-chip matching and power combination, commonly using on-chip transformers. Reliability often sets the limits for the PA design, and PA degradation mechanisms are reviewed. A compilation of state-of-the-art published results for linear and switched wattlevel PAs, as well as a few fully integrated CMOS PAs, is presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The biological effects of modulated radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields have been a subject of debate since early publications more than 30 years ago, suggesting that relatively weak amplitude-modulated RF electromagnetic fields have specific biological effects different from the well-known thermal effects of RF energy. This discussion has been recently activated by the increasing human exposure to RF fields from wireless communication systems. Modulation is used in all wireless communication systems to enable the signal to carry information. A previous review in 1998 indicated that experimental evidence for modulation-specific effects of RF energy is weak. This article reviews recent studies (published after 1998) on the biological effects of modulated RF fields. The focus is on studies that have compared the effects of modulated and unmodulated (continuous wave) RF fields, or compared the effects of different kinds of modulations; studies that used only one type of signal are not included. While the majority of recent studies have reported no modulation-specific effects, there are a few interesting exceptions indicating that there may be specific effects from amplitude-modulated RF fields on the human central nervous system. These findings warrant follow-up studies. Bioelectromagnetics 32:511\textendash 534, 2011. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {A cascode bipolar low-noise amplifier (LNA) with capacitive shunt feedback has been developed to present a solution for simultaneous noise and power match when the real part of the optimum source impedance is not 50 {$\Omega$} in order to keep high current density under power constraint. The proposed LNA also has the capability for the simultaneous improvement of noise figure (NF) and linearity. In addition, we analyzed and verified that the second-order interaction, which affects the third-order nonlinearity, becomes less sensitive to the low-frequency input termination at higher bias currents. The possibility of removing the low-frequency LC trap is investigated based on this analysis. We also show that LNAs with smaller base and/or smaller emitter resistances require lower source impedance at low frequencies to improve linearity by the same amount. Finally, prudent layouts for improving the performance of the LNA are considered. Eleven design examples of the proposed LNA, which individually operate at 880, 1575, or 1960 MHz, are fabricated in a low-cost 0.35- {$\mu$}m SiGe BiCMOS process to verify the design and analysis experimentally. The fabricated LNAs have excellent performances, especially in NF. For example, the 880-MHz LNA has an NF of 0.9 dB, a power gain of 16 dB, and an IIP3 of +14 dBm with current consumption of 11 mA from a 2.8-V power supply.},

Analysis of the detector transfer characteristic for sinusoidal input shows that the AC-induced error term involves the zero-order modified Bessel function of the first kind (I0). This result is not new, but it is often disregarded. The dynamic contribution is quite unlike the error that occurs for DC input, regardless of any compensatory modification of circuit parameters; which means that linearity correction schemes using a reference diode to produce a DC amplifier with a complementary gain law can never be perfect. It is also shown however, that the AC error is independent of frequency provided that the smoothing capacitor is 'large'. This means that the tracking detector system, which involves automatic self-calibration against a low-frequency precision rectifier, is theoretically sound. By considering the power dissipated in the detector, it is shown that the input impedance can be calculated using first and zero-order modified Bessel functions of the first kind (I0 and I1). This allows the determination of detector transfer-functions that take source impedance into account. When this facility is combined with the ability to calculate the dynamic component of the peak detection error, a measurement of DC output taken with a calibrated voltmeter can be converted into a measurement of AC input without the need for an AC reference. The computation procedures required are not simple, but they are described in detail and given as Basic algorithms readily adaptable to any programming environment.},

  abstract = {The resistive and reactive components of an impedance, including the sign of the reactance, can be determined by placing a resistance and a reactance in series with the impedance and making five scalar voltage measurements across pairs of points in the resulting network. It is also possible, using suitable combinations of the same 5 measurements, to determine impedance magnitude, phase tangent, conductance, susceptance, power factor, and (by making the reference resistance equal to the target load resistance) reflection coefficient and SWR. This article gives expressions for all of these quantities; and includes an error analysis in each instance to show how a standard deviation can be calculated. The error functions are well-behaved except for those related to the voltage reflection coefficient, the expression for which is not differentiable when its value is in the region of zero. A solution to that problem is to place a potential divider across the generator and make an additional bridge voltage measurement, this configuration being the same as is used in antenna analysers and return loss bridges. Although not suitable for permanent insertion into a transmission line; the series network can be used for simultaneous determination of load resistance, conductance and phase tangent, as is required for guaranteed convergence of impedance matching procedures involving series and parallel reactances.},

The key device in the system is the two-port phase modulator, which functions, in conjunction with a dispersive element in the loop, to form a high-Q microwave filter to perform microwave frequency selection. The central frequency of the microwave filter is a function of the optical wavelength and the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive element, therefore, the oscil-lation frequency can be simply tuned by tuning the wavelength of the laser source or the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive ele-ment. A theoretical analysis is provided, which is verified by exper-iments. The phase noise performance and the frequency tunability are both experimentally investigated.

Predicting the coupling from digital module to RF antennas and mitigating RF interference is important to the system performance. The ultimate goal of this study is to address the desensitization issues existing in modern electronic devices that have mixed high speed digital-RF circuits, such as cellphone and wearable devices. In order to estimate the near-field noise coupling from digital module to RF antennas, the noise source is anticipated to be replaced by its equivalent radiation model which can facilitate the near-field coupling analysis. This thesis focuses on modeling of radiation noise source and its application in RF interference applications. Two methods are proposed, equivalent dipole moment model and Huygens's equivalent model. The methodology of both methods will be introduced and later validated with full-wave simulation and measurement. Dipole moment model is extracted by Least-square and improved with global optimization, while Huygens's equivalent model is constructed in full-wave simulation tool. With equivalent noise source model, the near-field coupling between radiation noise source and RF antennas are estimated by either direct simulation or reciprocity theorem. Field data is obtained by near-field scanning with phase information. Measurement data shows good correlation and consistence for noise source modeling and near-field coupling.},

Several relatively straightforward approaches have been suggested, including gap and frill feeds. More complicated approaches, which involve including the coaxial feed cable in the FDTD calculation space, have also been suggested. A related aspect is the desirability of reducing the number of time steps required for FDTD calculations to converge, especially for transient excitation. In this paper we illustrate that for many geometries a simple gap model with an internal source resistance provides accurate results while greatly reducing the number of time steps required for convergence.},

The use of varactor diodes as tuning elements allows continuous and independent control of these parameters.

  abstract = {A new approach is presented for modelling three-dimensional lumped elements in the "nite-di!erence time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations. The "nite-di!erence equations for the lumped element's circuit behaviour are derived to produce discrete relationships between the device's terminal currents and voltages. These di!erence equations are then implemented in the FDTD grid with equivalent voltage and current sources based on static "eld approximations. The method can be used for a wide range of applications which include lumped elements that may be passive, active, linear, non-linear, single, and multiple port devices. The underlying advantages of modelling a lumped element in this manner as compared to the more traditional extended FDTD technique is that the lumped element is easily extended across multiple FDTD cells and the need for a separate transcendental equation solver is eliminated. The method is demonstrated by a speci"c example based on the Curtice\vphantom\{\}Cubic non-linear model for a MESFET. The s-parameters from an FDTD simulation are compared to the manufacturer's measured data and to results from simulations using Hewlett-Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS). Finally, the method is used to model the MESFET in a three port oscillator. Copyright 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It is shown that when phase shifters are used within the architecture of the array, the focal point moves as a function of frequency, which degrades the focusing performance of the antenna. To mitigate these limitations, time-delay units are proposed, and it is revealed that perfect focusing across a wide bandwidth can be achieved by this approach. To validate this concept, an UWB Vivaldi focused antenna array using time delays is designed which demonstrates good focusing capability across the UWB spectrum.},

Remarkably, real phase shifters can approach some of these idealized attributes. New processing techniques hold promise to significantly reduce manufacturing cost .},

The passband-width tunability is achieved by placing variable coupling reducers between the filter resonators. The coupling reducers, operating as bandwidth control subnetworks, are designed as detuned resonators made up of a line segment ending in a variable capacitor. The proposed filter structure is experimentally validated with the design, construction in suspended stripline technology, and characterization of a low-cost filter prototype for terrestrial digital video broadcasting receivers operating in the UHF band (470\textendash 862 MHz). Other relevant factors, such as the intermodulation distortion produced by the varactors used to control the bandwidth electronically or the power-handling performance of the constructed filter, are also discussed. The reconfigurable filter module described in this paper is very suitable for the design of flexible multifunction receiver subsystems simultaneously supporting signals with a different bandwidth.},

Our results show that E. coli DNA absorbs microwaves in the 8\textendash 12-GHz region substantially more efficiently than water, which is itself an extremely efficient absorber. The observed absorption is featureless and decreases slightly with increasing frequency. These observations are consistent with an explanation involving direct absorption by longitudinal acoustic modes of the double helix.},

This method utilizes near-field data to determine an equivalent magnetic current source over a fictitious surface which encompasses the antenna. This magnetic current, once determined, can be used to ascertain the near and the far fields. This method demonstrates that once the values of the electromagnetic field are known over an arbitrary geometry, its values for any other region can be obtained. An electric field integral equation is developed to relate the near fields to the equivalent magnetic current. A moment method procedure is employed to solve the integral equation by transforming it into a matrix equation. A least squares solution via singular value decomposition is used to solve the matrix equation. Computations with both synthetic and experimental data, where the near field of several antenna configurations are measured over various geometric surfaces, illustrate the accuracy of this method.

The transient field phenomena for each of the Floquet mode expansion were analyzed. The solution reduces to the case of far-zone field radiation by moving the focus point to the far zone. The analysis shows that the radiation exhibits an impulse field at the focused point, and finite pulses at locations away from the focus point. Phenomena of partial cylindrical wave functions have been observed.},

  abstract = {There has been ongoing debate and discussion concerning whether the funding source influenced the outcome of research on human health effects from exposure to radiofrequency fields (RF, electromagnetic waves that carry energy as they propagate in air and dense media). In a study of 225 publications, in which we sought to determine a possible association between the funding source(s), quality and outcome in a total of 2,160 genetic damage assessment tests of mammalian cells exposed to RF energy, we made several observations. One finding was that a great majority of researchers had acknowledged government agencies as the funding source (53\%, 120 of 225 publications), while a small number of scientists mentioned mobile phone industry as the financial source (9\%, 20 of 225 publications). Numerous investigators did not mention the funding source (26\%, 58 of 225 publications). Secondly, industry-funded investigations were of better quality and utilized quality control measures, i.e., blind evaluation, adequate description of dosimetry, positive controls and/or sham-exposed controls, compared to those funded by the government. Another observation was that in industry-funded studies, the d values (effect size or standardized mean difference between the cells exposed to RF energy and sham-exposed controls) were consistently lower than in government-funded studies. In addition, compared to government-funded studies, a higher percentage of industry-funded studies reported no difference in genetic damage between RF- and sham-exposed cells (80\% for industry-funded studies versus 49\% for government-funded studies). Finally, we observed that industry-funded studies were less likely to report an increase in genetic damage in cells exposed to RF energy (10\%) compared to government-funded studies (23\%). In view of the large difference between the percentage of publications funded by government and industry (53\% or 122 of 225 publications for government, compared to 9\% or 29 of 225 publications for industry), caution should be used when debating and discussing the above observations. Overall, it is important to include the quality control measures in the investigations, and also mention the funding source in published studies.},

  abstract = {"Do you want to design a wireless transmitter or receiver for hand-held telephones? Have you wondered why the printed circuit wires on high-frequency circuits don't always run in a straight line? This valuable text will answer all of your questions regarding component parasitics and circuit characterization for rf/microwave amplifier, oscillator, and filter circuit design and analysis. You will understand why capacitors act as inductors and vice versa and why amplifiers work like oscillators, while oscillators for local area networks work more like local area heaters. Application of the information in Introduction to Microwave Circuits will reduce design-cycle time and costs, markedly increasing the probability of first-time success in printed circuit or monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) design. Several approaches are taken into consideration, such as the effects of currents on the ground plane, bypass and coupling capacitors, and nonlinear effects in linear circuits. Featured topics include: * Incorporation of component parasitics in the design cycle * Closed form solution to oscillator design * Odd mode stability analysis * PIN diode analysis for high-power switching applications An integrated design example of a 1.25 GHz amplifier, oscillator, and filter printed circuit is also included, which could be useful in printed circuit board designs from tens of megahertz to tens of gigahertz. Introduction to Microwave Circuits provides the tools necessary to analyze or synthesize microwave circuits. This text is an essential reference for undergraduate students, microwave engineers, and administrators. Also, it will assist experienced designers in other fields to meet the current rapid expansion of communication system applications and work effectively in microwave circuit design. About the Author Robert J. Weber began his prolific career in the Solid State Research Laboratory at the Collins Radio Company, later a part of Rockwell International.

  abstract = {In the field of microwave engineering and circuit design, the Wilkinson Power Divider is a specific class of power divider circuit that can achieve isolation between the output ports while maintaining a matched condition on all ports.  The Wilkinson design can also be used as a power combiner because it is made up of passive components and hence reciprocal. First published by Ernest J. Wilkinson in 1960, this circuit finds wide use in radio frequency communication systems utilizing multiple channels since the high degree of isolation between the output ports prevents crosstalk between the individual channels.
It uses quarter wave transformers, which can be  easily fabricated as quarter wave lines on printed circuit boards. It is also possible to use other forms of transmission line (e.g. coaxial cable) or lumped circuit elements (inductors and capacitors).},

But, over the past several years SiGeC BiCMOS technology has pushed GaAs out of many of these sockets due to it's high performance, high level of integration, and low cost attributes. Will this trend continue to the power amplifier? Is this technology really cheaper to develop and manufacture RF product solutions than GaAs? Is SiGeC really the RF technology of the future, or only a short-lived fad to be pushed aside by RF CMOS? This paper will explore the driving factors behind these questions, and moreover, explore the product entry and manufacturing cost differences for GaAs HBT, and SiGeC BiCMOS technology.},

Also, the propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the body. Simulation results show that about 34\% to 42\% of the incident power is reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation of safety compliance is proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Characterization of the frequency response of coherent radiometric receivers is a key element in estimating the flux of astrophysical emissions, since the measured signal depends on the convolution of the source spectral emission with the instrument band shape. Laboratory Radio Frequency (RF) measurements of the instrument bandpass often require complex test setups and are subject to a number of systematic effects driven by thermal issues and impedance matching, particularly if cryogenic operation is involved. In this paper we present an approach to modeling radiometers bandpasses by integrating simulations and RF measurements of individual components. This method is based on QUCS (Quasi Universal Circuit Simulator), an open-source circuit simulator, which gives the flexibility of choosing among the available devices, implementing new analytical software models or using measured S-parameters. Therefore an independent estimate of the instrument bandpass is achieved using standard individual component measurements and validated analytical simulations. In order to automate the process of preparing input data, running simulations and exporting results we developed the Python package python-qucs and released it under GNU Public License. We discuss, as working cases, bandpass response modeling of the COFE and Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) radiometers and compare results obtained with QUCS and with a commercial circuit simulator software. The main purpose of bandpass modeling in COFE is to optimize component matching, while in LFI they represent the best estimation of frequency response, since end-to-end measurements were strongly affected by systematic effects.},
