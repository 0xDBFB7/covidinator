In particular, a two-dimensional selfconsistent electrostatic model is used to analyze equilibrium beam transport in a periodic magnetic focusing field in the absence of radio-frequency signal, and the behavior of a high-intensity electron beam under a current-oscillation-induced mismatch between the beam and the periodic magnetic focusing field. Detailed simulation results are presented for choices of system parameters corresponding to the 50 MW, 11.4 GHz periodic permanent magnet (PPM) focusing klystron experiment performed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). It is found from the self-consistent simulations that sizable halos appear after the beam envelope undergoes several oscillations, and that the residual magnetic field at the cathode plays an important role in delaying the halo formation process.","2000-06","2019-10-21 20:49:18","2019-10-21 20:49:18","2019-10-21 20:49:18","502-510","","3","28","","IEEE Trans.

Named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, it consisted of an orbiter and an entry probe. It was delivered into Earth orbit on October 18, 1989 by Space Shuttle Atlantis. Galileo arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth, and became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. It launched the first probe into Jupiter, directly measuring its atmosphere. Despite suffering major antenna problems, Galileo achieved the first asteroid flyby, of 951 Gaspra, and discovered the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, around 243 Ida. In 1994, Galileo observed Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9's collision with Jupiter.Jupiter's atmospheric composition and ammonia clouds were recorded, the clouds possibly created by outflows from the lower depths of the atmosphere. Io's volcanism and plasma interactions with Jupiter's atmosphere were also recorded. The data Galileo collected supported the theory of a liquid ocean under the icy surface of Europa, and there were indications of similar liquid-saltwater layers under the surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede was shown to possess a magnetic field and the spacecraft found new evidence for exospheres around Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo also discovered that Jupiter's faint ring system consists of dust from impacts on the four small inner moons. The extent and structure of Jupiter's magnetosphere was also mapped.On September 21, 2003, after 14 years in space and 8 years in the Jovian system, Galileo's mission was terminated by sending it into Jupiter's atmosphere at a speed of over 48 kilometers per second (30 mi/s), eliminating the possibility of contaminating local moons with terrestrial bacteria.","2019-10-19","2019-10-22 20:15:02","2019-10-22 20:15:06","2019-10-22 20:15:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 921988932","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/QXEQK3RF/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The free-stream utility was improved such that a spatially uniform ﬁeld of particles gets inserted now yielding reliable results for the cells located close to these patches. Implementation of the collision models were validated for two test cases (monatomic gas mixtures and diatomic gas) by observing the equilibration of both the kinetic and internal energies. It was found that the present code had good agreement to the independent codes of HAWK and SMILE as well as to results by G. Bird. The validation of the present codes treatment for the gas/surface interactions was evaluated using the benchmark case of Rothe’s nozzle measurements. Results show that the present version of dsmcFoam obtained good agreements for this case compared to the measurements of Rothe for density and temperature.

The probes for the three smallest volumes utilize a novel auxiliary tuning inductor for which the design criteria are given. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and line width of water samples are measured. Based on the measured DC resistance of the microcoils, together with the calculated radio frequency (RF) resistance of the tuning inductor, the SNR is calculated and shown to agree with the measured values. The details of the calculations indicate that the auxiliary inductor does not degrade the NMR probe performance.

The propellant considered in this propulsion concept is water. Different microchannels geometries were analysed presenting the impact of the divergent angle on the thruster performance. It is shown that the transmission coefficient plays an important role towards the optimization of the heater chip. Results show that when the transmission coefficient increases by changing the geometry the specific impulse decreases, while the thrust and power consumption increase. In addition, a heater chip with a grid containing 37x37 microchannels with modified geometry can achieve a thrust in the range from 0.286 to 2.923 mN, a specific impulse from 54.4 to 93.7 s, and a maximum power consumption of 0.32 W.","","2019-10-22 02:52:44","2019-10-22 02:59:37","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/A7NB937E/2016_SPc_HEATER_CHIP_WITH_DIFFERENT_MICROCHANNELs_GEOMETRIES_FOR_A_LOW_PRESSURE_FREE_MOLECULAR_MICRO_RESISTOJET (1).pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An oxygen ion beam of diameter 3 mm with energy of 5 keV was extracted from an ion source and the ion beam entered the lens system from a distance of 100 mm. Seven design parameters were identified as variable parameters in the presence of space charge current of 0.1 mA. These parameters are the separation between each electrode of the lens, the aperture diameter of the outer electrodes of the lens system, the aperture diameter of the intermediate electrode, the focusing points at different distances for singly charged oxygen ion trajectories, the applied voltage to the intermediate electrode and the influence of space charge on beam quality and also study of the influence of the mass for the different elements has been investigated. Beam quality was significantly improved when the applied voltage to the intermediate electrode was optimized and found at V2 = - 4500 V, separation distance (gap between each electrode) = 20 mm, the aperture diameter of the lens system = 40 mm and finally the best focused point was found at a distance of 550 mm from the end of the lens system.","","2019-10-21 20:47:08","2019-10-22 02:59:37","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/34K8CF5S/ionbeamsimulation.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/6UG32NA3/ionbeamsimulation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of Elmer ﬁnite element method (FEM) software for verifying plasma engineering design is presented as an accessible tool that can help modeling multi-physics and verifying plasma generation devices. Furthermore, Elmer FEM will be suitable for experienced engineer and can be used for determining the risks in a design or a process that use plasma.

A ﬂexible experimental setup with a rotating contact is designed to support this study. Based on the magnetohydrodynamic arc model, the elongation and the commutation behaviour of the arc plasma during the contact rotation progress are simulated. Under the given conditions of the external magnetic ﬁeld and the contact rotating velocity, the arc motion is described in detail by the temperature distribution. The stagnation together with the following rapid jump of two arc roots is observed by both calculation and experiment. The rapid rise in the arc voltage is mainly caused by the increasing difference between the two arc roots displacement in the moving direction, and the jump instant of the arc root on the moving contact is according to the moment of the maximal voltage value.","2007-02-07","2019-10-22 02:59:06","2019-10-22 02:59:06","2019-10-22 02:59:06","795-802","","3","40","","J.

The focusing magnet is designed so that it can be cooled with a pair of 1.5 W (at 4.2 K) coolers. The MICE cooling channel has three focusing magnets with their absorbers. The three focusing magnets will be hooked together in series for a circuit stored-energy of about 9.0 MJ. Quench protection for the focusing magnets i s discussed. This report presents the mechanical and thermal design parameters for this magnet, including the results of finite element calculations of mechanical forces and heat flow in the magnet cold mass.","2005-06","2019-10-22 02:58:44","2019-10-22 02:58:44","2019-10-22 02:58:44","1259-1262","","2","15","","IEEE Trans.

It is the process that, at various stages, initiates or triggers associated processes including erosion, collapse and subsidence. The dissolution of sulphate rocks proceeds by different mechanisms and at different rates to those associated with the dissolution of carbonate rocks. For each rock type different factors influence the process. This chapter is an attempt to summarise the present knowledge of the dissolution chemistty and kinetics of gypsum and anhydrite. These are important for the genetic interpretation of karst features in these rocks. The gypsum-anhydrite-gypsum transitions and recrystallization processes are also addressed, because of their importance to karst development. Many studies have been undertaken on the solubility and dissolution of sulphate minerals, in the context of construction engineering and karst processes. Important works include these of Laptev (1939), Kuznetzov (1947), Shternina (1949), Zdanovsky (1956), Sokolov (1962), Zverev (1967), Lui & Nancollas (1971), Blount & Dickson (1973), Mel'nikova & Moshkina (1973), Wigley (1973), Gorbunova (1977), James & Lupton (1978), Kushnir (1988).

It was found that the polymer matrix became completely insoluble in aqueous solution after baked at low temperature around 100 oC and then turned to be highly soluble in aqueous solution, even in neutral water, when exposed to high temperature above 200 oC. Systematic investigations by using DSC, TG and FTS and a homemade apparatus for monitoring film thickness change in dissolving revealed that the insolubilization at low temperature was enabled by thermally induced crosslinking between vinyl group of the bisvinyl ether monomer and carboxyl group of the copolymer and the solubilization at high temperature was the result of acidcatalyzed decrosslinking. The sulfonyl group of the copolymer acted as a thermal acid generator. Preliminary imaging experiments showed that this polymer matrix could be possibly applied in thermal laser imaging.","","2019-10-26 00:38:30","2020-01-06 02:15:57","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VVXJPDRS/Wu et al. - A Novel Polymer Matrix Capable of Crosslinking and.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/FI8493ED/Wu et al. - A Novel Polymer Matrix Capable of Crosslinking and.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VIZ8GWPH/Wu et al. - A Novel Polymer Matrix Capable of Crosslinking and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two types of aerospace components were produced, a low-force rocket thruster and a simulated airfoil section. The rocket was tested in a test stand using varying mixtures of H2 and O2, whereas the simulated airfoil was tested by subjecting it to a 0.3 Mach jet-fuel burner flame. Both parts performed successfully, demonstrating the usefulness of the rapid prototyping in efforts to effect materials substitution. In addition, the simulated airfoil was used to explore the possibility of applying thermal/environmental barrier coatings and providing for internal cooling of ceramic parts. It is concluded that this strategy for processing offers the ceramic engineer all the flexibility normally associated with investment casting of superalloys.","","2019-10-27 17:01:48","2020-01-06 01:47:28","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/FXEB9U89/20010060375.pdf","","grade_a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, aluminum nitride films were formed on aluminum substrates by gas nitriding in order to improve their low emissivities. To accomplish this, aluminum alloys were subjected to nitriding conditions at 773 and 823 K for 0–5 h, using alumina and magnesium powders. The resulting aluminum nitride films were several micrometers thick and the films were dark brown or black. The surface structures of the aluminum nitride films were investigated using a scanning electron microscope, which showed fine acicular aluminum nitride nodules with diameters on the order of several micrometers. Emissivities were evaluated at 298 K using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in a wavelength range of 2–14 µm. Total emissivities at temperatures between 323 and 383 K were estimated from emissivity results obtained at 298 K. It was subsequently found that emissivity decreases with increasing wavelength and an emissivity of 0.80 was observed at a wavelength of 2 µm. Total emissivity was 0.49 % at 298 K and was in excess of 0.50 between 323 and 383 K.","","2019-10-29 04:26:09","2019-10-29 04:26:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/FXBMSF5Q/Yoshida et al. - Surface Structure and Emissivity of Aluminum Nitri.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/9V2PM5GA/summary.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of silica coating layers constituted with various structural titania particles (solid, hollow, and core-shell spherical), the dependence of transmittance and emissivity of the coating layer on the particle structure and the layer thickness was investigated and optimized.

"GZXMGI8P","journalArticle","","Lieben, Curt H","Emittance and absorptance of NASA ceramic thermal barrier coating system","","","","","","Normal spectral emittance measurements were made on a two-layer ceramic thermal barrier coating system developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center. This system consists of a metal substrate, a NiCrAlY bond coating, and a yttria-stabilized ceramic coating. The normal spectral emittance was used to calculate the thermal radiation properties of hemispherical total absorptance and emittance of the NASA coating system. The normal spectral emittance of the coating system was obtained at a single bond coating thickness of 0.010 centimeter, at ceramic coating thicknesses of zero to 0 . 0 7 6 centimeter, at wavelengths of 0.4 to 14.6 micrometers and at temperatures of 300 to 1590 K. These data were transformed into hemispherical total emittance values and correlated with respect to ceramic coating thickness and temperature using multiple regression curve fitting techniques. Equations were obtained which can be easily used by a designer to calculate the coating system hemispherical total absorptance a t temperatures of 700 to 2800 K and the coating system hemispherical total emittance at ternperatures of 700 to 1590 K. The data show that the NASA coating system is highly reflective and therefore can significantly reduce radiation heat loads on cooled gas turbine engine components. Calculation of the radiant heat transfer within the nonisothermal, translucent ceramic coating material shows that a designer, with little loss of accuracy, can use the gas-side ceramic coating surface temperature in heat transfer analysis of radiation head loads on the coating system.","","2019-10-29 04:41:13","2019-10-29 04:41:13","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/636FBKYM/19780018205.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A tapecasting slurry is a complex system where each organic component has a substantial eflect on the rheological behaviour. In this study the eflect of the dispersant and binders in alumina aqueous tapecasting slurries were characterized with electrophoretic mobility and rheological measurements. In aqueous medium, a 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3_benzenedisulfonic acid, wasfound to be a very eflective dispersant for alumina. The amount of dispersant required to achieve a minimum of viscosity was equal to 0.2 wt%. Two aqueous emulsions of acrylic polymers were used as binders. These binders strongly aflect the rheology of the suspensions. The best conditions to obtain a homogeneous stable slurry with a high powder loading suitable for tapecasting were determined in terms of order of component addition, rheological behaviour and ageing of the suspensions. Acrylic binders should act through a cohesive mechanism and lead to green tapes with good mechanical strength.

Zeta potential values of the alumina particle charges in the suspensions were measured using an Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude (ESA) measurement apparatus (Model ESA 8000 Matec). This technique is based upon the acoustic wave which is generated by the respective motion of the electric double-layer ions and of the charged particles submitted to a high frequency alternating electric field (1 MHz). This motion generates a sound wave at the same frequency as the electric field with an amplitude proportional to the electrostatic potential at the shear plane where the zeta potential is defined, to the particle concentration and to the amplitude of the applied electric field. The ultrasonic signal is detected and converted to a voltage (ESA) by a piezoelectric transducer. In the case of our suspensions, the ESA data are directly proportional to the zeta potential, then the curves of variations of the electrokinetic properties in function of pH and/or dispersant amounts will be presented with ESA values as the Y axis.</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/LEPZ6I79/Pagnoux et al. - 1998 - Aqueous suspensions for tape-casting based on acry.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, various dielectric supporting rods are simulated by one or several uniform cylinders having an effective dielectric constant, while metal vane loading and plasma effects are incorporated in the effective dielectric constant.","","2019-11-14 23:15:32","2019-11-14 23:15:33","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/MQZM6ILA/19940030764.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fourteen students and staff complained of nausea, dyspnea, or respiratory irritation immediately after inhaling the gas. On arrival at Saint Luke's International Hospital, more than half of the patients presented with low-grade fever. Symptoms spontaneously resolved soon after admission, although the low-grade fever persisted until the following morning. Low-grade fever after inhalation exposure is not explicable by hydrogen chloride inhalation and therefore appeared to be caused by titanium dioxide inhalation, manifesting as metal fume fever. Titanium dioxide is thought to have no remarkable human toxicity and is considered to be safe clinically. To our knowledge, this is the first report of titanium dioxide inhalation as the potential cause of metal fume fever in humans. Correlations between the degree of fever and quantity and concentration of inhaled titanium dioxide remain to be determined.","2008-06-01","2019-11-18 17:02:48","2019-11-18 17:02:48","2019-11-18 17:02:48","608-611","","5","26","","The American Journal of Emergency Medicine","Acute group poisoning by titanium dioxide","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/88UM3YMW/S0735675707005384.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We do not attempt a chapter-by-chapter evaluation, but instead focus on two areas: computational complexity and fundamental physics. In complexity, we address some of the questions Wolfram raises using standard techniques in theoretical computer science. In physics, we examine Wolfram's proposal for a deterministic model underlying quantum mechanics, with 'long-range threads' to connect entangled particles. We show that this proposal cannot be made compatible with both special relativity and Bell inequality violation.","2002-07-30","2019-11-21 05:24:51","2019-11-21 05:24:51","2019-11-21 05:24:51","","","","","","","Book Review","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: quant-ph/0206089","Comment: Revised version. 14 pages, to appear in Quantum Information & Computation, September 2002","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ANASDM4I/Aaronson - 2002 - Book Review 'A New Kind of Science'.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/A8AHG9KF/0206089.html","","","Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the summer of 1998, Norvir semi-solid capsules supplies were threatened as a result of a new much less soluble crystal form of ritonavir. This report provides characterization of the two polymorphs and the structures and hydrogen bonding network for each form. Methods. Ritonavir polymorphism was investigated using solid state spectroscopy and microscopy techniques including solid state NMR, Near Infrared Spectroscopy, powder X-ray Diffraction and Single crystal X-ray. A sensitive seed detection test was developed. Results. Ritonavir polymorphs were thoroughly characterized and the structures determined. An unusual conformation was found for form II that results in a strong hydrogen bonding network A possible mechanism for heterogeneous nucleation of form II was investigated. Conclusions. Ritonavir was found to exhibit conformational polymorphism with two unique crystal lattices having significantly different solubility properties. Although the polymorph (form II) corresponding to the “cis” conformation is a more stable packing arrangement, nucleation, even in the presence of form II seeds, is energetically unfavored except in highly supersaturated solutions. The coincidence of a highly supersaturated solution and a probable heterogeneous nucleation by a degradation product resulted in the sudden appearance of the more stable form II polymorph.","","2019-12-13 19:44:35","2019-12-13 19:44:35","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/48TJAN8J/Bauer 2001.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes an interactive geometry editor, ray tracing support for graphics rendering and geometric analysis, computer network distributed framebuffer support, scripting, image-processing and signal-processing tools. The entire package is distributed in source code and binary form. Although BRL-CAD can be used for a variety of engineering and graphics applications, the package's primary purpose continues to be the support of ballistic and electromagnetic analyses. In keeping with the Unix philosophy of developing independent tools to perform single, specific tasks and then linking the tools together in a package, BRL-CAD is basically a collection of libraries, tools, and utilities that work together to create, raytrace, and interrogate geometry and manipulate files and data. In contrast to many other 3D modelling applications, BRL-CAD primarily uses CSG rather than boundary representation. This means BRL-CAD can ""study physical phenomena such as ballistic penetration and thermal, radiative, neutron, and other types of transport"" It does also support boundary representation.The BRL-CAD libraries are designed primarily for the geometric modeler who also wants to tinker with software and design custom tools. Each library is designed for a specific purpose: creating, editing, and ray tracing geometry, and image handling. The application side of BRL-CAD also offers a number of tools and utilities that are primarily concerned with geometric conversion, interrogation, image format conversion, and command-line-oriented image manipulation.","2019-11-09","2019-12-16 02:01:57","2019-12-16 02:01:59","2019-12-16 02:01:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 925334760","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/D4TS89FD/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given a 3D object and a stacking direction, we deﬁne a measure of stackability, which is derived from the gap between the lower and upper envelopes of the object in a stacking conﬁguration along the stacking direction. The main challenge in stackabilization lies in the desire to modify the object’s geometry only subtly so that the intended functionality and aesthetic appearance of the original object are not signiﬁcantly affected. We present an automatic algorithm to deform a 3D object to meet a target stackability score using energy minimization. The optimized energy accounts for both the scales of the deformation parameters as well as the preservation of pre-existing geometric and structural properties in the object, e.g., symmetry, as a means of maintaining its functionality. We also present an intelligent editing tool that assists a modeler when modifying a given 3D object to improve its stackability. Finally, we explore a few fun variations of the stackabilization problem.","2012-11-01","2019-12-16 02:59:35","2019-12-16 02:59:35","2019-12-16 02:59:35","1","","6","31","","ACM Trans.

The high-temperature multilayer insulation investigated consisted of gold-coated reflective foils separated by alumina fibrous insulation spacers. The steady-state heat transfer through four multilayer insulation configurations was investigated experimentally over the temperature range of 300-1300 K and environmental pressure range of 1.33 × 10-5-101.32 kPa. It was shown that including the reflective foils reduced the effective thermal conductivity compared to fibrous insulation sample at 1.5 times the density of the multilayer sample. A finite volume numerical model was developed to solve the governing combined radiation/conduction heat transfer equations. The radiation heat transfer in the fibrous insulation spacers was modeled using the modified two-flux approximation assuming anisotropic scattering and gray medium. The numerical model was validated by comparison with steady-state experimental data. The root mean square deviation between the predicted and measured effective thermal conductivity of the samples was 9.5%.","","2019-12-16 03:19:59","2020-03-10 16:43:26","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/LELPAXH4/20080013560.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/SRZS33JU/Daryabeigi et al. - HEAT TRANSFER IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE MULTILAYER INSUL.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Crosslinking is always accompanied by photolysis of the sensitizer. In the absence of the sensitizer, no crosslinking occurred. The gel content increased with irradiation time, and tended to a limiting value, depending on the initial sensitizer concentration. The final gel content increased as a function of the initial amount of sodium benzoate. A plot of solubility (S + S1/2) against the reciprocal of the concentration of sensitizer converted gives a straight line in each case. The number of crosslinks is directly related to the number of sensitizer molecules destroyed. The crosslinking occurred predominantly, and main-chain scission was negligible. This result is in marked contrast to the effect of ionizing radiation, since the ionizing radiation causes only degradation under the identical conditions. This ultraviolet method was applied successfully to the crosslinking of water-soluble cellulose derivatives, such as methyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.","1965","2019-12-17 21:23:39","2020-03-10 16:57:27","2019-12-17 21:23:39","3217-3224","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 1965 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ALTZHSHX/app.1965.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/Y36DE962/Takakura et al_1965_Ultraviolet-induced crosslinking of poly (vinyl alcohol) in the presence of.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/33F865ZC/Takakura et al. - 1965 - Ultraviolet-induced crosslinking of poly(vinyl alc.pdf","","grade_a; refbase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this method, there is requirement of only a small amount of Isobam (0.3 wt%) and neither initiators nor dispersants are needed for preparation and gelation of a 50 vol% solids loaded alumina slurry. The gelation rate increased with increasing solids loading but decreased with increasing Isobam content. A typical gelation time was 38 min for the slurry containing 50 vol% solids loading and 0.3 wt% Isobam. The resultant wet gel was strong enough to allow reversible bending and twisting. This simple gelling system is attractive for wet forming of ceramics because only a single additive, which acts as both dispersant and gelling agent at room temperature in air, is used.","2013-06-14","2019-12-17 23:13:35","2019-12-17 23:13:35","2019-12-17 23:13:35","1512-1516","","11","28","","J.

It was found that, at mole ratios of the PVA- to SA repeat units of 20/1 to 80/1, the DN gels likely evolved a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) morphology of rigid alginate networks dispersed in while interlocking with ductile PVA network to accomplish DN synergy that gave their high strength and toughness, where the high alginate rigidity originated probably from its dense cross-link induced syneresis and dispersion along crosslink-defective voids to result in little internal stress concentration. Tentatively mechanistically, as the 20/1–80/1 DN gels were stretched steadily, their mechanical response was gradually differentiated into distinct synergistic states: the sparsely hydrogen-bonded PVA served as a ductile matrix to bear small fractions of the established stresses at its large elongations; whereas the densely ionically (               i.e.               Ca               2+               ) cross-linked alginate functioned as a rigid skeleton to sustain the remaining larger stresses upon its smaller local strains. Promisingly, this ductile-rigid matrix-skeleton synergistic mechanism of semi-IPN morphology may be universally extended to all A/B DN hydrogels of large A–B rigidity (or cross-link density) contrast, whether the cross-link nature of network(s) A or B is covalent, ionic, hydrogen bonded or van der Waals interacted. The strong and tough DN gels also displayed satisfactory self-recovery of viscoelastic behaviour, in that their Young's modulus and dissipated energy in the uniaxial tensile mode and dynamic storage and loss moduli in the oscillatory shear mode all recovered significantly from non-linear viscoelastic regimes despite different degrees of failure to revert to (quasi)linear viscoelasticity.","2018","2019-12-18 00:01:37","2020-01-06 01:27:17","2019-12-18 00:01:37","16674-16689","","30","8","","RSC Adv.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/IB3I6SRV/Li et al. - 2018 - Strong, tough and mechanically self-recoverable po.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/JNSMH4Z3/Li et al. - 2018 - Strong, tough and mechanically self-recoverable po.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/HDCL3RJK/c8ra01302k.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2) The gels had a lower glass transition temperature than PVA. (3) The glass transition temperature of the wet gels increased with increasing crosslink density. Possible explanations are provided for these observations. Whereas the thermogravimetric curves of PVA exhibited a single degradation peak, two degradation peaks were detected for the crosslinked PVA. The wet PVA and PVA gels displayed lower tensile strengths and higher elongations than the dried ones. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"CTNMWW9E","journalArticle","","Marin, Edwin; Rojas, John; Ciro, Yhors","A review of polyvinyl alcohol derivatives: Promising materials for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications","","","","","","In recent years, a technological breakthrough in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields have been reflected in the development of more complex, safe and effective dosage forms to improve the administration, delivery, disposition and stability of drugs, as well as at creating more biocompatible and biodegradable materials. As a result, modified release devices and functional coatings which improve the effectiveness and efficacy of drugs have been generated. This advancement has been achieved by physical or chemical modification of natural or semisynthetic polymers which stabilize and protect drugs against harsh environmental factors. Therefore, the development of novel excipients with a high functionality and robustness has become an important quest. Among these materials, polyvinyl alcohol is one of the most versatile and biocompatible, since by chemical or physical modification its properties are modulated, improving drug stability, drug targeting, and ensures patient compliance. Freezing-thawing cycles, heat treatment and formation of composites are the most significant physical modifications to improve the performance of polyvinyl alcohol. On the other hand, the chemical modifications by cross-linking with aldehydes, carboxylic acids, sodium tetraborate, epichlorohydrin have enhanced the physical and mechanical properties, such as the oil sorption ability, oxygen and waterproof characteristics, mechanical strength, drug diffusion and rate of swelling.","","2019-12-20 19:56:22","2019-12-20 19:56:23","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/Y32C6UQ3/Polyvinyl-alcohol-derivatives-Promising-materials-for-pharmaceutical-and-biomedical-applications.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the first review to look across the broad field of ‘cold water immersion’ and to determine the threats and benefits associated with it as both a hazard and a treatment. What advances does it highlight? The level of evidence supporting each of the areas reviewed is assessed. Like other environmental constituents, such as pressure, heat and oxygen, cold water can be either good or bad, threat or treatment, depending on circumstance. Given the current increase in the popularly of open cold water swimming, it is timely to review the various human responses to cold water immersion (CWI) and consider the strength of the claims made for the effects of CWI. As a consequence, in this review we look at the history of CWI and examine CWI as a precursor to drowning, cardiac arrest and hypothermia. We also assess its role in prolonged survival underwater, extending exercise time in the heat and treating hyperthermic casualties. More recent uses, such as in the prevention of inflammation and treatment of inflammation-related conditions, are also considered. It is concluded that the evidence base for the different claims made for CWI are varied, and although in most instances there seems to be a credible rationale for the benefits or otherwise of CWI, in some instances the supporting data remain at the level of anecdotal speculation. Clear directions and requirements for future research are indicated by this review.","2017","2019-12-25 22:11:02","2019-12-25 22:11:04","2019-12-25 22:11:02","1335-1355","","11","102","","","Cold water immersion","","","","","","","en","© 2017 The Authors.

The optimization strategy varies signiﬁcantly across architectures, types of stencils, and types of applications. The standard approach to adapting stencil computations to different architectures, used by both compilers and application programmers, is through the use of iteration space tiling, whereby the data footprint of the computation and its computation partitioning are adjusted to match the memory hierarchy and available parallelism of different platforms. In this paper, we explore an alternative performance portability strategy for stencils, a data layout library for stencils called bricks, that adapts data footprint and parallelism through ﬁne-grained data blocking. Bricks are designed to exploit the inherent multi-dimensional spatial locality of stencils, facilitating improved code generation that can adapt to CPUs or GPUs, and reducing pressure on the memory system. We demonstrate that bricks are performance-portable across CPU and GPU architectures and afford performance advantages over various tiling strategies, particularly for modern multi-stencil and highorder stencil computations. For a range of stencil computations, we achieve high performance on both the Intel Knights Landing (Xeon Phi) and Skylake (Xeon) CPUs as well as the NVIDIA P100 (Pascal) GPU delivering up to a 5× speedup against tiled code.","2018-11","2019-12-26 02:08:21","2019-12-26 02:08:21","2019-12-26 02:08:21","59-70","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Dallas, TX, USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/293E8P57/p3hpc-bricks-final.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Performance, Portability and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing (HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure) represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of the whole set of particles. The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and multi-purpose GPUs. Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user defined heterogeneous data structures.","2018-03","2019-12-28 00:14:57","2020-04-25 04:31:38","2019-12-28 00:14:57","325-332","","","224","","Computer Physics Communications","SoAx","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1710.03462","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/KX2YBDJE/Homann and Laenen - 2018 - SoAx A generic C++ Structure of Arrays for handli.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ATL55TD4/1710.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/R2S6QFY9/1710.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/8U7C2JRE/Homann_Laenen_2018_SoAx.pdf","","","Physics - Computational Physics; Computer Science - Mathematical Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as the incident energy was increased to 20 eV and above, the likelihood of both adatom reﬂection and sputtering of predeposited atoms rapidly increased. The probability of reﬂection increased with the angle of incidence and was greatest for oblique (glancing) angle impacts. The reﬂected adatoms were strongly forward scattered and retained a large fraction of their initial incident energies. The resputtering yield was highest for incident angles around 40° to the surface normal. The resputtered atoms were typically ejected with signiﬁcantly smaller energies than those of the incident atoms, and were preferentially ejected in the forward direction with a maximum probability at an angle of about 45° to the surface normal. These results have been compared with the published experimental data for low energy ion impact. The dependence of the reﬂection probability, the resputtering yield, as well as the angular and energy distributions of both reﬂected and resputtered atoms upon the adatom’s incident energy and angle have been obtained and ﬁtted to simple relations suitable for incorporation in models of vapor deposition. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Despite its industrial relevance the bonding mechanism is mainly only qualitatively understood and is almost solely applied to the bonding of silicon to Pyrex glass. The objective of the present paper is to review the current state of knowledge of the anodic bonding process. Possible material combinations and current scientific and industrial applications of this bonding technique are reviewed. The various aspects of the bonding process, such as the creation of intimate contact, the cation movement in the glass and the interfacial chemical reactions, are discussed in detail and related to the external current measured during bonding to describe the bonding process quantitatively. A better understanding of the process itself should help not only to improve the process control and the quality of devices, but also to broaden the application of this successful bonding technique to more challenging designs, to smaller device sizes and to systems other than silicon–Pyrex glass.","2006-10","2020-01-06 01:51:10","2020-01-06 01:51:10","2020-01-06 01:51:10","273-311","","5","51","","International Materials Reviews","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/S8GBD7TI/Knowles and van Helvoort - 2006 - Anodic bonding.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the context of unstructured meshes, however, maintaining good parallel eﬃciency is diﬃcult with multiplicative iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel. This leads us to consider alternative smoothers. We discuss the computational advantages of polynomial smoothers within parallel multigrid algorithms for positive deﬁnite symmetric systems. Two particular polynomials are considered: Chebyshev and a multilevel speciﬁc polynomial. The advantages of polynomial smoothing over traditional smoothers such as Gauss-Seidel are illustrated on several applications: Poisson’s equation, thin-body elasticity, and eddy current approximations to Maxwell’s equations. While parallelizing the Gauss-Seidel method typically involves a compromise between a scalable convergence rate and maintaining high ﬂop rates, polynomial smoothers achieve parallel scalable multigrid convergence rates without sacriﬁcing ﬂop rates. We show that, although parallel computers are the main motivation, polynomial smoothers are often surprisingly competitive with Gauss-Seidel smoothers on serial machines.","2003-07","2020-01-06 01:52:51","2020-01-06 01:52:52","2020-01-06 01:52:51","593-610","","2","188","","Journal of Computational Physics","Parallel multigrid smoothing","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/DTADIS53/Adams et al. - 2003 - Parallel multigrid smoothing polynomial versus Ga.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vacuum system was made from locally available materials and designed for efficiency required for vacuum casting. The equipment was used to melt and cast small sized specimens using the lost wax technique and compared with green sand and ceramic mould cast specimens. Tensile and shrinkage tests were carried out on all specimens. The results of the tensile tests were 123, 98 and 113 MPa for the vacuum cast, green sand cast and ceramic mould cast spec imens, respectively. Furthermore, shrinkage defect which is common to both green sand and ceramic mould casting was eliminated in vacuum casting. The vacuum casting equipment cost an equivalent of about U.S $1000.00 (One thousand dollars) to construct and can be easily scaled up for large sized castings by increasing furnace capacity and the size of the moulding flask.","2010-04","2020-01-06 01:57:14","2020-01-14 04:05:56","2020-01-06 01:57:14","124-130","","2","51","","Russ.

"9485B7AP","journalArticle","","Rotundo, S; Hughel, G; Rebarchak, A; Lin, Y; Farouk, B","Design, Construction and Operation of a Traveling-Wave Pulse Tube Refrigerator","","","","","","A low cost traveling-wave pulse tube refrigerator was designed, built, and successfully operated. The main goal of the project was to understand the working principles of such a device and attempt to build and operate the system with atmospheric air as the working medium. We used the thermoacoustic modeling software DeltaE effectively to design the air operated system with well defined constraints and performance parameters. The designed pulse tube components were fabricated based upon the DeltaE results and solid modeling layouts. A jig-saw was reconfigured to serve as the compressor to provide oscillating gas flow. The refrigerator was found to cool room temperature air down to about -45°C a difference of about 75°C between hot and cold regions of the pulse tube. This result is quite remarkable considering the facts that an ingenious drive for the compressor was used and that atmospheric air was used as the working medium (instead of high pressure helium). Additional tests were done using a unique regenerator comprised of stainless steel and nylon screens to help reduce the axial conduction within the regenerator. The refrigerator was then able to reach a temperature of about -60°C. This is an improvement over traditional regenerators that only use stainless screens. For the attainment of cryogenic temperatures, high power density in the pulse tube is essential. Our system does however, operate along the same principles and will exhibit similar behavior, thus allowing extrapolation of what effects or improvements might be expected in a high pressure helium system. Future tests are planned with pressurized helium as the working medium.","","2020-01-06 01:58:46","2020-01-06 01:58:46","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/H9CDYJDB/Rotundo et al. - Design, Construction and Operation of a Traveling-.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At T-junction conﬁgurations, which occur wherever resolution diﬀers between neighbouring cells, use of the standard centred diﬀerence gradient stencil requires that ghost values be constructed by interpolation. To properly recover second order accuracy in the resulting numerical gradients, prior work addressing block-structured grids and graded trees has shown that quadratic, rather than linear, interpolation is required; the gradients otherwise exhibit only ﬁrst order convergence, which limits potential applications such as ﬂuid ﬂow. However, previous schemes fail or lose accuracy in the presence of the more complex T-junction geometries arising in the case of general non-graded quadtrees, which place no restrictions on the resolution of neighbouring cells. We therefore propose novel quadratic interpolant constructions for this case that enable second order convergence by relying on stencils oriented diagonally and applied recursively as needed. The method handles complex tree topologies and large resolution jumps between neighbouring cells, even along the domain boundary, and both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are supported. Numerical experiments conﬁrm the overall second order accuracy of the method in the L∞ norm.","2017-02","2020-01-06 02:07:47","2020-01-06 02:07:47","2020-01-06 02:07:47","49-72","","","331","","Journal of Computational Physics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/5DMM7PFL/Batty - 2017 - A cell-centred finite volume method for the Poisso.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Virtual restorations based on common red–green–blue images (RGB) which remove the degradations and then ﬁll the lacuna regions with the image’s known parts with the inpainting technology could produce a visually plausible result. However, due to the lack of information inside the degradations, they always yield inconsistent structures when stains cover several color materials. To eﬀectively remove the stains and restore the covered original contents of Chinese paintings, a novel method based on Poisson editing is proposed by exploiting the information inside the degradations of selected three feature bands as the auxiliary information to guide the restoration since the selected feature bands captured fewer stains and could expose the covered information. To make the Poisson editing suitable for stain removal, the feature bands were also exploited to search for the optimal patch for the pixels in the stain region, and the searched patch was used to construct the color constraint on the original Poisson editing to ensure the restoration of the original color of paintings. Speciﬁcally, this method mainly consists of two steps: feature band selection from hyperspectral data by establishing rules and reconstruction of stain contaminated regions of RGB image with color constrained Poisson editing. Four Chinese paintings (‘Fishing’, ‘Crane and Banana’, ‘the Hui Nationality Painting’, and ‘Lotus Pond and Wild Goose’) with diﬀerent color materials were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Visual results show that this method can eﬀectively remove or dilute the stains while restoring a painting’s original colors. By comparing values of restored pixels with nonstained pixels (reference of their same color materials), images processed by the proposed method had the lowest average root mean square error (RMSE), normalized absolute error (NAE), and average diﬀerences (AD), which indicates that it is an eﬀective method to restore the stains of Chinese paintings.","2019-06-10","2020-01-06 02:10:39","2020-01-06 02:15:53","2020-01-06 02:10:39","1384","","11","11","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/X5UIWX7J/Zhou et al. - 2019 - Virtual Restoration of Stained Chinese Paintings U.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/NSGNPPL4/Zhou et al. - 2019 - Virtual Restoration of Stained Chinese Paintings U.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-powered systems are a new emerging technology, which allows the use of a system or a device that perform a function without the need for external power source like for example, a battery or any other type of source. This technology can for example use harvested energy from sources around us such as ambient mechanical vibrations, noise, and human movement, etc. and convert it to electric energy using the piezoelectric effect. For nanoscale devices, the size of traditional batteries is not suitable and will lead to loss of the concept of “nano”. This is due to the large size and the relatively large magnitude of the delivered power from traditional sources. The development of a nanogenerator (NG) to convert energy from the environment into electric energy would facilitate the development of some self-powered systems relying on nano- devices.","2016-11-11","2020-01-06 02:10:45","2020-01-06 02:16:02","2020-01-06 02:10:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Linköping University","Linköping, Sweden","en","","Ph.D.","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.3384/diss.diva-131858","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/92PVYJ5C/Satti Nour - 2016 - Development of Zinc Oxide Piezoelectric Nanogenera.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/D4XGNG4A/Satti Nour - 2016 - Development of Zinc Oxide Piezoelectric Nanogenera.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to study the effects of crystal structure of the graphite products on their electric properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD) structural parameters, such as, average interlayer spacing (d002), crystallite sizes (Lc and La) and graphitization degree (P1), were measured by the methodology as outlined in JIS R7651. For the temperature dependence of resistivity of these products, it was observed that the minimum resistivity was located at the temperature ranges from 450 to 700 °C. From the relationship between the temperature dependence of resistivity and XRD structural parameters of the graphite products, some control factors of electrical properties at high temperature was discussed. Between the electrical resistivity at ambient temperature and P1, a mutual relationship could be observed. It was seen that the normalized value of the minimum from the ambient resistivity was related with d002. The temperature showing the minimum resistivity was lowered with enlargement of crystallite size along the a-axis, La. The slope of temperature dependence of resistivity at 1000 °C showed a correlation with La.","2013-09","2020-01-06 02:20:41","2020-01-06 02:20:41","2020-01-06 02:20:41","602-608","","","61","","Carbon","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/22AXF4EL/Iwashita et al. - 2013 - Variation of temperature dependence of electrical .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach includes a novel heuristic Poisson preconditioner well suited for massively-parallel SIMD processing. Furthermore, we address the problem of limited transfer rates over typical data channels such as the PCI-express bus relative to the bandwidth requirements of powerful GPUs. Specifically, naive communication schemes can severely reduce the achievable speedup in such communication-intense algorithms. For this reason, we employ overlapping memory transfers to establish a high level of concurrency and to improve scalability. We have implemented our model on a high-performance workstation with multiple hardware accelerators.

"Y9F3YQ24","journalArticle","","Duperrier, R","Space charge neutralization and its dynamic effects","","","","","","High-power accelerators are being studied for several projects including accelerator driven neutron or neutrino sources. The low energy part of these facilities has to be carefully optimized to match the beam requirements of the higher energy parts. In this low energy part, the space charge self force, induced by a high intensity beam, has to be carefully controlled. This nonlinear force can generate a large and irreversible emittance growth of the beam. To reduce the space charge (SC), neutralization of the beam charge can be done by capturing some particles of the ionised residual gas in the vacuum chamber. This space charge compensation (SCC) regime complicates the beam dynamics study. This contribution aims to modelize the beam behavior in such regime and to provide criteria to the linac designer to estimate the neutralization rise time and the neutralization degree.","","2020-01-06 22:40:44","2020-01-06 22:40:45","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/R4TRNKEQ/weax03.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"L5JTZTPY","book","2002","Mead, Carver A.","Collective Electrodynamics: Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism","","978-0-262-63260-7","","","","In this book Carver Mead offers a radically new approach to the standard problems of electromagnetic theory. Motivated by the belief that the goal of scientific research should be the simplification and unification of knowledge, he describes a new way of doing electrodynamics―collective electrodynamics―that does not rely on Maxwell's equations, but rather uses the quantum nature of matter as its sole basis. Collective electrodynamics is a way of looking at how electrons interact, based on experiments that tell us about the electrons directly. (As Mead points out, Maxwell had no access to these experiments.) The results Mead derives for standard electromagnetic problems are identical to those found in any text. Collective electrodynamics reveals, however, that quantities that we usually think of as being very different are, in fact, the same―that electromagnetic phenomena are simple and direct manifestations of quantum phenomena. Mead views his approach as a first step toward reformulating quantum concepts in a clear and comprehensible manner. The book is divided into five sections: magnetic interaction of steady currents, propagating waves, electromagnetic energy, radiation in free space, and electromagnetic interaction of atoms. In an engaging preface, Mead tells how his approach to electromagnetic theory was inspired by his interaction with Richard Feynman.","2002-07-26","2020-01-08 07:11:10","2020-01-08 07:11:10","","","159","","","","","Collective Electrodynamics","","","","","The MIT Press","Cambridge, Mass","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.ca/Collective-Electrodynamics-Quantum-Foundations-Electromagnetism/dp/0262632608/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=collective+electrodynamics&qid=1578467304&sr=8-1#customerReviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Revised ed. edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What appears to be an innocuous aspect in the experimental setup may in fact introduce a significant bias in an evaluation. This phenomenon is called measurement bias in the natural and social sciences.  Our results demonstrate that measurement bias is significant and commonplace in computer system evaluation. By significant we mean that measurement bias can lead to a performance analysis that either over-states an effect or even yields an incorrect conclusion. By commonplace we mean that measurement bias occurs in all architectures that we tried (Pentium 4, Core 2, and m5 O3CPU), both compilers that we tried (gcc and Intel's C compiler), and most of the SPEC CPU2006 C programs. Thus, we cannot ignore measurement bias. Nevertheless, in a literature survey of 133 recent papers from ASPLOS, PACT, PLDI, and CGO, we determined that none of the papers with experimental results adequately consider measurement bias.  Inspired by similar problems and their solutions in other sciences, we describe and demonstrate two methods, one for detecting (causal analysis) and one for avoiding (setup randomization) measurement bias.","2009","2020-01-11 00:32:03","2020-01-11 00:32:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","","https://api.semanticscholar.org/ccfb05b5b7239a076677df91f31f67abf18cb205","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our technique is based on a new ambient sound ﬁngerprint called the Acoustic Background Spectrum (ABS). An ABS serves well as a room ﬁngerprint because it is compact, easily computed, robust to transient sounds, and surprisingly distinctive. As with other ﬁngerprint-based localization techniques, location is determined by measuring the current ﬁngerprint and then choosing the “closest” ﬁngerprint from a database. An experiment involving 33 rooms yielded 69% correct ﬁngerprint matches meaning that, in the majority of observations, the ﬁngerprint was closer to a previous visit’s ﬁngerprint than to any ﬁngerprints from the other 32 rooms. An implementation of ABS-localization called Batphone is publicly available for Apple iPhones. We used Batphone to show the beneﬁt of using ABS-localization together with a commercial WiFi-based localization method. In this second experiment, adding ABS improved room-level localization accuracy from 30% (Wi-Fi only) to 69% (Wi-Fi and ABS). While Wi-Fibased localization has diﬃculty distinguishing nearby rooms, Batphone performs just as well with nearby rooms; it can distinguish pairs of adjacent rooms with 92% accuracy.","2011","2020-01-13 22:13:18","2020-01-14 02:36:49","2020-01-13 22:13:18","155","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Press","Bethesda, Maryland, USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/DPVD2IHG/Tarzia et al. - 2011 - Indoor localization without infrastructure using t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","the 9th international conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The programmable gate driver Rout is implemented using a segmented output stage technique. This gate driver IC is designed and fabricated using TSMC’s 0.18μm BCD Gen-2 process. Experimental results are obtained by measuring the current distribution between two parallel connected IGBTs (600V, 90A).

Recently computational cancer biologists examined gene expression in seven types of solid cancers and traced the ancestry of the active genes they found. Genes that date all the way back to single-celled organisms were revved up. In contrast, genes unique to animals had gone quiet. In cancer, gene-crippling mutations, particularly in genes that interact with both ancient and younger genes, can cause those constraints to break down, so uncontrolled growth occurs. Some of those cancer-driving genes have so many links to other genes that cancer treatments, which usually target just one connection, have limited effects, they proposed.

Sensitivity is also demonstrated to the kinetics of gel formation and melting, and associated hysteresis effects upon cyclic temperature sweeps. Furthermore, simple acoustic models of the sol and gel state enable estimation of the speed of sound and compressibility of gelatin.

At room temperature, a high-volume-fraction solids, shear-thinning suspension was produced. The suspension remained in a liquidlike state for ∼24 h. By contrast, at elevated temperatures, DHF became active as a cross-linking agent for chitosan, and a rapid transition from liquidlike to solidlike suspension behavior was apparent. The rate of gelation and the gel strength increased with increased temperature and increased DHF concentration. Gelation occurred at pH 1.4–4.5, which is a complex function of pH. At pH above ∼4, rapid gelation was not possible because of the low-pH solution conditions required for the cross-linking reaction. An examination of the strength and shape-forming properties of several Al2O3–chitosan–DHF systems showed them to be suitable for production of strong, reliable, complex-shaped ceramic components. In particular, small, dense Al2O3 pseudorotors were formed and found to be of sufficient strength for mold removal and subsequent handling. In all formulations examined, chitosan concentrations of <0.5 wt% (by weight of ceramic) were required; therefore, the need for a discrete binder burnout process was eliminated.","2002","2020-01-22 18:44:35","2020-01-22 18:44:39","2020-01-22 18:44:35","1699-1705","","7","85","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/I9UWSR96/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00338.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ZH8RII2K/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00338.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By identifying the essential parameters that determine the suitability of a molecule for a terahertz laser, almost any rotational transition of almost any molecular gas can be made to lase. Nitrous oxide is used to illustrate the broad tunability over 37 lines spanning 0.251 to 0.955 terahertz, each with kilohertz linewidths.

Data Sources: Over 100 articles from both basic science and clinical medical literature selected for relevance to concussive brain injury, postinjury pathophysiology, and recovery of function. Data Synthesis: The primary elements of the pathophysiologic cascade following concussive brain injury include abrupt neuronal depolarization, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, ionic shifts, changes in glucose metabolism, altered cerebral blood flow, and impaired axonal function. These alterations can be correlated with periods of postconcussion vulnerability and with neurobehavioral abnormalities. While the time course of these changes is well understood in experimental animal models, it is only beginning to be characterized following human concussion. Conclusions/Recommendations: Following concussion, cerebral pathophysiology can be adversely affected for days in animals and weeks in humans. Significant changes in cerebral glucose metabolism can exist even in head-injured patients with normal Glasgow Coma Scores, underscoring the need for in-depth clinical assessment in an effort to uncover neurocognitive correlates of altered cerebral physiology. Improved guidelines for clinical management of concussion may be formulated as the functional significance and duration of these postinjury neurometabolic derangements are better delineated.","2001","2020-01-28 01:01:39","2020-01-28 01:01:43","2020-01-28 01:01:39","228-235","","3","36","","J Athl Train","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 12937489 PMCID: PMC155411","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/85CB969J/Giza and Hovda - 2001 - The Neurometabolic Cascade of Concussion.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC155411/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is known by different names in different disciplines.  In particular, it is similar to the velocity Verlet method, which is a variant of Verlet integration. Leapfrog integration is equivalent to updating positions                         x         (         t         )                 {\displaystyle x(t)}    and velocities                         v         (         t         )         =                                                x               ˙                                          (         t         )                 {\displaystyle v(t)={\dot {x}}(t)}    at interleaved time points, staggered in such a way that they ""leapfrog"" over each other. Leapfrog integration is a second-order method, in contrast to Euler integration, which is only first-order, yet requires the same number of function evaluations per step. Unlike Euler integration, it is stable for oscillatory motion, as long as the time-step                         Δ         t                 {\displaystyle \Delta t}    is constant, and                         Δ         t         ≤         2                    /                  ω                 {\displaystyle \Delta t\leq 2/\omega }   .Using Yoshida coefficients, applying the leapfrog integrator multiple times with the correct timesteps, a much higher order integrator can be generated.","2020-01-22","2020-01-29 16:47:01","2020-01-29 16:47:12","2020-01-29 16:47:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 936978291","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/Z5Y5DESN/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of radio bursts from the Sun and the galactic background were calculated at the same frequency and were found that radio bursts from the Sun will reduce the occurrence probability of Jovian radio bursts much more than radio bursts from the galactic background. The distribution of Jovian radio bursts was different; the occurrence probability with respect to the northern latitudes was more than the southern latitudes.","","2020-02-01 19:33:07","2020-02-01 19:33:07","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/2AVW7YNY/Ibrahim - PROPERTIES OF JOVIAN RADIO BURSTS AT FREQUENCY 20..pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A module containing new pumps, an accumulator, a CO2 storage tank, and instrumentation will be connected to the cut tubes during the EVA.  When the 4 mm OD x 0.7 mm wall stainless steel tubes are cut with an EVA-adapted tubing cutter, the ends will neck down.  Reaming the tube end to its full inner diameter is not tenable owing to the possibility of creating debris and the undesirable use of a sharp object on EVA.  The pressure drop associated with the connections made to the repair module must be understood to ensure proper operation.  If the pressure drop caused by the cut tube neckdown is severe and is not uniform from cut to cut, it could cause unacceptable flow maldistribution in the Tracker cooling loop.      A water pressure drop test was performed on test sections with internal dimensions identical to the mated repair configuration.  The test was designed to obtain information that would allow the pressure drop from the repair to be predicted.  This document describes the test setup, the test and the results, compares the results to predictions in the literature, provides a recommended pressure drop prediction methodology, and defines an allowable neckdown diameter ratio.","2018-07-08","2020-02-05 04:52:12","2020-02-05 04:52:12","2020-02-05 04:52:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","ttu-ir.tdl.org","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/WY6P5WTD/Ungar and Walker - 2018 - Pressure Drop Caused by the Neckdown of Cut Tubes.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/PIVGL5DF/74095.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An improved approach, described in this report, consists of impregnating the fiber with a solution of the appropriate monomers instead of a solution of previously synthesized high-molecular-weight polymers. Polymerization of the monomers occurs in situ on the fiber during the solvent removal and curing stages. The in situ polymerization approach greatly simplifies the fabrication of PPQ - graphite fiber composites. The use of low-viscosity, monomeric-type solutions facilitates fiber wetting, permits a high solid content, and eliminates the need for prior polymer synthesis.","","2020-02-12 23:37:54","2020-02-12 23:37:59","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/NZSV5NVM/19740026849.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The electric conductivity of the PVA aqueous solution increases rapidly and the growth slows down along with the increase of citric acid content. The viscosity of 13 wt % PVA aqueous solutions with citric acid had a small increase and remained stable in one week, which was suitable for electrospinning fibers. Porous, interconnected nonwoven nanofiber membranes were electrospun from a thoroughly mixing of PVA / citric acid aqueous solution. The membranes were then heat treated at 140 oC for 2 h. The postelectrospinning crosslinked nanofiber membranes were insoluble in water, while the non-crosslinked electrospun nanofiber membranes dissolved instantaneously. FT-IR spectrum, X-ray diffraction, and DSC thermograms reveal that crosslinking of PVA nanofiber membranes occurred through esterfication reaction during heat treatment.","","2020-02-13 01:30:32","2020-02-13 01:30:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RR4UFXGZ/Shi and Yang - Green electrospinning and crosslinking of polyviny.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/BCWM8YKV/summary.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This irreversibly dissolves the starch granule in water. Water acts as a plasticizer.     Three main processes happen to the starch granule: granule swelling, crystallite or double helical melting, and amylose leaching. During heating, water is first absorbed in the amorphous space of starch, which leads to a swelling phenomenon. Water then enters via amorphous regions the tightly bound areas of double helical structures of amylopectin. At ambient temperatures these crystalline regions do not allow water to enter. Heat causes such regions to become diffuse, the amylose chains begin to dissolve, to separate into an amorphous form and the number and size of crystalline regions decreases. Under the microscope in polarized light starch loses its birefringence and its extinction cross. Penetration of water thus increases the randomness in the starch granule structure, and causes swelling; eventually amylose molecules leach into the surrounding water and the granule structure disintegrates.The gelatinization temperature of starch depends upon plant type and the amount of water present, pH, types and concentration of salt, sugar, fat and protein in the recipe, as well as starch derivatisation technology are used. Some types of unmodified native starches start swelling at 55 °C, other types at 85 °C.  The gelatinization temperature of modified starch depends on, for example, the degree of cross-linking, acid treatment, or acetylation. Gel temperature can also be modified by genetic manipulation of starch synthase genes. Gelatinization temperature also depends on the amount of damaged starch granules; these will swell faster. Damaged starch can be produced, for example, during the wheat milling process, or when drying the starch cake in a starch plant. There is an inverse correlation between gelatinization temperature and glycemic index. High amylose starches require more energy to break up bonds to gelatinize into starch molecules. Gelatinization improves the availability of starch for amylase hydrolysis. So gelatinization of starch is used constantly in cooking to make the starch digestible or to thicken/bind water in roux, sauce, or soup.","2019-11-24","2020-02-13 01:33:12","2020-02-13 01:33:16","2020-02-13 01:33:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 927676171","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/7VEAPQY3/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their physical properties are similar to soft tissues. Cross linking is a stabilization process in polymer chemistry which leads to multidimensional extension of polymeric chain resulting in network structure. Cross-link is a bond which links one polymer chain to other. It can be ionic or covalent. Cross linking changes a liquid polymer into ‘solid’ or ‘gel’ by restricting the ability of movement. When polymer chains are linked together by cross-links, they lose some of their ability to move as individual polymer chains. A liquid polymer (where the chains are freely flowing) can be turned into a ‘solid’ or ‘gel’ by cross-linking the chains together. Cross linking increases the molecular mass of a polymer. Cross-linked polymers are important because they are mechanically strong and resistant to heat, wear and attack by solvents.

The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure, mechanical and dielectric properties, and thermal shock resistance of the fused silica ceramics was investigated. The results showed that sintering temperature has a critical effect. Use of an appropriate sintering temperature will promote densiﬁcation and improve the strength, thermal shock resistance, and dielectric properties of fused silica ceramics. However, excessively high sintering temperature will greatly facilitate crystallization of amorphous silica and result in more cristobalite in the sample, which will cause deterioration of these properties. Fused silica ceramics sintered at 1275°C have the maximum ﬂexural strength, as high as 81.32 MPa, but, simultaneously, a high coefﬁcient of linear expansion (2.56 9 10À6/K at 800°C) and dramatically reduced residual ﬂexural strength after thermal shock (600°C).

Properly done, such a seal is hermetic (vacuum tight, good electrical insulation, special optical properties e.g. UV lamps).  To achieve such a seal, two properties must hold: The molten glass must be capable of wetting the metal, in order to form a tight bond, and The thermal expansion of the glass and metal must be closely matched so that the seal remains solid as the assembly cools.Thinking for example about a metal wire in a glass bulb sealing, the metal glass contact can break if the CTEs (coefficient of thermal expansion) are not well aligned. For the case that the CTE of the metal is larger than the CTE of the glass, the sealing shows a high probability to break upon cooling. By lowering the temperature, the metal wire shrinks more than the glass does, leading to a strong tensile force on the glass, which finally lead to breakage. On the other hand, if the CTE of the glass is larger than the CTE of the metal wire, the seal will tighten upon cooling since compression force is applied on the glass. According to all requirements that need to be fulfilled and the strong necessity to align the CTE of both materials, there only a few companies offering specialty glass for glass-metal sealing. Such as SCHOTT AG and  Morgan Advanced Materials.","2019-12-17","2020-02-15 16:39:04","2020-02-15 16:39:04","2020-02-15 16:39:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 931117448","<p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"">copper...to improve the bonding to glass, the oxide layer should be borated; this is achieved by e.g. dipping the hot part into a concentrated solution of<span> </span></span><a style=""text-decoration: none; color: #0b0080; background: none #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"" title=""Borax"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borax"">borax</a><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;""><span> </span>and then heating it again for certain time.

The experimental results on piezoactuators show its e ciency and prove its interest for the precise control of microactuators without the use of sensors.

Various issues are associated with this control problem, such as low stability margin due to the sharp resonant peak, nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainty, etc. As such, damping controllers are often utilised to damp the mechanical resonance of the nanopositioners. The Integral Resonant Controller (IRC) is used in this paper as a damping controller to damp the mechanical resonance. A further inherent problem is the hysteresis phenomenon (disturbance), which leads to degrading the positioning performance (accuracy) of the piezo-driven stage. The common approach to treat this disturbance is to invoke tracking controllers in a closed-loop feedback scheme in conjunction with the damping controllers. The traditional approach uses the Integral Controller (I) or Proportional Integral (PI) as a tracking controller, whereas this paper introduces the Proportional and Integral (PI)-like Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) as a tracking controller. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes over conventional schemes is confirmed through comparative simulation studies, and results are presented. The stability boundaries of the proposed control schemes are determined in the same way as with a conventional controller. Robustness against variations in the resonant frequency of the proposed control schemes is verified.","2018-03","2020-02-15 22:25:50","2020-02-15 22:25:50","2020-02-15 22:25:50","10","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/UZE3XB9H/Altaher_Aphale_2018_High-Precision Control of a Piezo-Driven Nanopositioner Using Fuzzy Logic.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/BEEEB5CD/10.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"AKR6W2WT","journalArticle","","Condon, James J","Collapse of the 300 foot telescope","","","","","","The 300 foot telescope was the ﬁrst large telescope “readily available to all comers” and taught the NRAO how to run a national observatory. Although it was conceived as a “quick and dirty” stopgap with a ﬁve-year lifetime, the 300 foot telescope was upgraded many times and remained scientiﬁcally productive for 26 years. Its unexpected collapse in 1988 paved the way for its vastly improved successor, the GBT, and may have saved radio astronomy in Green Bank. Friends of the 300 foot fondly remember it as a symbol of radio astronomy in its bold, creative, simple, and sometimes foolish younger days.","","2020-02-16 17:12:33","2020-03-14 00:07:09","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>A panel of engineers investigated the collapse and issued their report in March 1989. Chairman Robert M. Matyas, a management consultant in Ithaca, N.Y., told ENR [Engineering News-Record] that a gusset plate connecting truss members “where the load [of the dish] was transmitted to the bearing . . . had been cracking for years and finally ran out of cross section.” Noting that the structure lasted “two or three times” its design life, Matyas said there was “no way the collapse could have been anticipated. Progressive fatigue cracking is microscopic” and detection of a gusset-plate crack among the highly interdependent structural members would have required disassembly. However, it turns out that the collapse could have been anticipated without disassembly because astronomical observations are exquisitely sensitive to tele- ZAPPED! .. . by Hostile Space Aliens! 329 scope geometry. When I later found time to analyze the 1988 data from the GB6 survey, I discovered that the telescope had already been failing at the beginning of my observing run a month prior to the collapse. In 1986 and 1987 the pointing hysteresis (the mean difference between positions measured by north-going and south-going scans) had been about 10 arcsec; in 1988 the hysteresis had grown to 30–50 arcsec. Even more ominously, during the final week before the collapse the north-south beamwidth increased from 3 arcmin to 4–5 arcmin. Had I been able to keep up with the data while observing, I would have realized that the dish was opening up by a significant fraction of the 6 cm wavelength and stopped the telescope. The 300 foot would not have collapsed, there would have been no disaster to justify emergency funding for the GBT, and the Green Bank site might have been closed. In this case, ignorance really was bliss: Green Bank may have been saved by the slow computers of the day and by inefficient single-dish analysis software.</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RKZSX7J8/Condon - ZAPPED! . . . by Hostile Space Aliens!.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The massively parallel nature of computing on a GPU nessecitated the development of new methods for various steps of the PIC method. I investigated different algorithms and data structures used in the past for GPU PIC codes, as well as developed some of new ones. The results of this research and development were used to implement an efficient multi-GPU version of the 3D3v PIC code SCEPTIC3D. The performance of the SCEPTIC3DGPU code was evaluated and compared to that of the CPU version on two different systems. For test cases with a moderate number of particles per cell, the GPU version of the code was 71x faster than the system with a newer processor, and 160x faster than the older system. These results indicate that SCEPTIC3DCPU can run problems on a modest workstation that previously would have required a large cluster.","2012","2020-02-21 15:49:37","2020-02-21 15:49:43","2020-02-21 15:49:37","","","","","","","","","","","","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","","eng","M.I.T. theses are protected by  copyright.

In order to continue to improve the environmental performance of PV manufacturing using proposed industrial symbiosis techniques, this paper performs a life cycle analysis (LCA) on both conventional 1 GW-scaled a-Si:H-based single junction and aSi:H/microcrystalline-Si:H tandem cell solar PV manufacturing plants and such plants coupled to silane recycling plants. Both the energy consumed and greenhouse gas emissions are tracked in the LCA, then silane gas is reused in the manufacturing process rather than standard waste combustion. Using a recycling process that results in a silane loss of only 17 percent instead of conventional processing that loses 85 percent silane, results in an energy savings of 81,700 GJ and prevents 4,400 tons of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere per year for the single junction plant. Due to the increased use of silane for the relatively thick microcrystalline-Si:H layers in the tandem junction plants, the savings are even more substantial - 290,000 GJ of energy savings and 15.6 million kg of CO2 eq emission reductions per year. This recycling process reduces the cost of raw silane by 68 percent, or approximately $22.6 million per year for a 1 GW a-Si:Hbased PV production facility and over $79 million per year for tandem manufacturing. The results are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the technical feasibility and environmental benefits of silane recycling in an eco-industrial park centered around a-Si:H-based PV manufacturing plants.","2013-01","2020-02-21 17:05:31","2020-02-21 17:05:31","2020-02-21 17:05:31","44-49","","","70","","Resources, Conservation and Recycling","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VWPH5PYP/Kreiger et al. - 2013 - Life cycle analysis of silane recycling in amorpho.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The exercise was organised according to a plan containing sixty written questions; the compiled answers, relaying accounts on not only the damage sustained by the earthquake but also information on the local geography, demography, history, and economy, are valuable historical documents and are stored in the country's National Archive.Because Secretary Carvalho e Melo (today more commonly known by the title of Marquis of Pombal) was the first to attempt an objective description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.

This blind analysis of 140.2 kg day of data taken between July 2007 and September 2008 revealed three WIMP-candidate events with a surface-event background estimate of 0.41+0.20−0.08(stat)+0.28−0.24(syst). Other known backgrounds from neutrons and 206Pb are limited to <0.13 and <0.08 events at the 90% confidence level, respectively. The exposure of this analysis is equivalent to 23.4 kg day for a recoil energy range of 7–100 keV for a WIMP of mass 10 GeV/c2. The probability that the known backgrounds would produce three or more events in the signal region is 5.4%. A profile likelihood ratio test of the three events that includes the measured recoil energies gives a 0.19% probability for the known-background-only hypothesis when tested against the alternative WIMP+background hypothesis. The highest likelihood occurs for a WIMP mass of 8.6 GeV/c2 and WIMP-nucleon cross section of 1.9×10−41 cm2.","2013-12-16","2020-02-22 00:46:27","2020-02-22 00:46:27","2020-02-22 00:46:27","251301","","25","111","","Phys.

IEEE conference on high performance extreme computing. IEEE Conference on High Performance Extreme Computing","","","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4652951/","Managing memory between the CPU and GPU is a major challenge in GPU computing. A programming model, Unified Memory Access (UMA), has been recently introduced by Nvidia to simplify the complexities of memory management while claiming good overall performance. In this paper, we investigate this programming model and evaluate its performance and programming model simplifications based on our experimental results. We find that beyond on-demand data transfers to the CPU, the GPU is also able to request subsets of data it requires on demand. This feature allows UMA to outperform full data transfer methods for certain parallel applications and small data sizes. We also find, however, that for the majority of applications and memory access patterns, the performance overheads associated with UMA are significant, while the simplifications to the programming model restrict flexibility for adding future optimizations.","2014-09","2020-02-24 04:05:24","2020-02-24 04:05:24","2020-02-24 04:05:24","","","","2014","","IEEE Conf High Perform Extreme Comput","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26594668 PMCID: PMC4652951","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/55FG5U6N/Landaverde et al_2014_An Investigation of Unified Memory Access Performance in CUDA.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4652951/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assist the research community, we report a software usability study in which 40 researchers across different disciplines prepared scholarly texts with either Microsoft Word or LaTeX. The probe texts included simple continuous text, text with tables and subheadings, and complex text with several mathematical equations. We show that LaTeX users were slower than Word users, wrote less text in the same amount of time, and produced more typesetting, orthographical, grammatical, and formatting errors. On most measures, expert LaTeX users performed even worse than novice Word users. LaTeX users, however, more often report enjoying using their respective software. We conclude that even experienced LaTeX users may suffer a loss in productivity when LaTeX is used, relative to other document preparation systems.

Currently, white LEDs with high color rendering are mainly based on wavelength conversion by one or more phosphor materials. This Review first describes how to quantify the quality of a light source, discussing the color rendering index (CRI) and alternative color quality indices. Then, six main criteria are identified and discussed, which should be fulfilled by a phosphor candidate to be considered for actual application in LEDs. These criteria deal with the shape and position of the emission and the excitation spectra, the thermal quenching behavior, the quantum efficiency, the chemical and thermal stability and finally with the occurrence of saturation effects. Based on these criteria, the most common dopant ions (broad-band emitting Eu2+, Ce3+ and Mn2+, lineemitting rare earth ions,...) and host compounds (garnets, sulfides, (oxy)nitrides,...) are evaluated. Although many phosphor materials have been proposed in literature in recent years, the number of phosphors effectively fulfilling all six requirements is relatively small.","2011","2020-02-28 00:27:33","2020-03-10 16:42:35","2020-02-28 00:27:33","R37","","6","158","","J.

It is a known issue that the beam quality can be artificially degraded by numerical Cherenkov radiation (NCR) resulting primarily from an incorrectly modeled dispersion relation. Pseudo-spectral solvers featuring infinite order stencils can strongly reduce NCR, or even suppress it, and are therefore well suited to correctly model the beam properties. For efficient parallelization of the PIC algorithm, however, localized solvers are inevitable. Arbitrary order pseudo-spectral methods provide this needed locality. Yet, these methods can again be prone to NCR. Here, we show that acceptably low solver orders are sufficient to correctly model the physics of interest, while allowing for parallel computation by domain decomposition.","2017-03","2020-03-04 20:31:25","2020-03-04 20:31:27","2020-03-04 20:31:25","033115","","3","24","","Physics of Plasmas","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1611.05712","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/3ELX9FG3/1611.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ZGA63VRR/Jalas et al_2017_Accurate modeling of plasma acceleration with arbitrary order pseudo-spectral.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These droplets could have provided chemical reaction centers. However, whether these droplets could divide and propagate is unclear. Here we examine the behavior of droplets in systems that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an external supply of energy. In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet growth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets into two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemically active droplets can exhibit cycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells. Dividing active droplets could serve as a model for prebiotic protocells, where chemical reactions in the droplet play the role of a prebiotic metabolism.","2017-04","2020-03-06 22:02:00","2020-03-06 22:02:00","2020-03-06 22:02:00","408-413","","4","13","","Nature Phys","Growth and Division of Active Droplets","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1603.01571","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/8VUHCI3P/Zwicker et al. - 2017 - Growth and Division of Active Droplets A Model fo.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/YKHKGPAF/1603.html","","","Condensed Matter - Soft Condensed Matter; Physics - Biological Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"AEQK6CW6","encyclopediaArticle","2019","","Galactic algorithm","Wikipedia","","","","https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Galactic_algorithm&oldid=932863355","A galactic algorithm is one that runs faster than any other algorithm for problems that are sufficiently large, but where ""sufficiently large"" is so big that the algorithm is never used in practice.  Galactic algorithms were so named by Richard Lipton and Ken Regan, as they will never be used on any of the merely terrestrial data sets we find here on Earth. An example of a galactic algorithm is the fastest known way to multiply two numbers, which is based on a 1729-dimensional Fourier transform. This means it will not reach its stated efficiency until  the numbers have at least 2172912 bits (at least 101038 digits), which is vastly larger than the number of atoms in the known universe. So this algorithm is never used in practice.Despite the fact that they will never be used, galactic algorithms may still contribute to computer science: An algorithm, even if impractical, may show new techniques that may eventually be used to create practical algorithms. Computer sizes may catch up to the crossover point, so that a previously impractical algorithm becomes practical. An impractical algorithm can still demonstrate that conjectured bounds can be achieved, or alternatively show that conjectured bounds are wrong.  As Lipton says ""This alone could be important and often is a great reason for finding such algorithms. For example, if tomorrow there were a discovery that showed there is a factoring algorithm with a huge but provably polynomial time bound, that would change our beliefs about factoring.

The code is based on the DSMC method of Bird[11.1] and models from free-molecular to continuum flowfields in either cartesian (x, y) or axisymmetric (z, r) coordinates. Computational particles, representing a given number of molecules or atoms, are tracked as they have collisions with other particles or surfaces. Multiple species, internal energy modes (rotation and vibration), chemistry, and ion transport are modelled. A new trace species methodology for collisions and chemistry is used to obtain statistics for small species concentrations. Gas phase chemistry is modelled using steric factors derived from Arrhenius reaction rates or in a manner similar to contiuum modelling. Surface chemistry is modelled with surface reaction probabilities; an optional site density, energy dependent, coverage model is included. Electrons are modelled by either a local charge neutrality assumption or as discrete simulational particles. Ion chemistry is modelled with electron impact chemistry rates and charge exchange reactions. Coulomb collision cross-sections are used instead of Variable Hard Sphere values for ion-ion interactions. The electro-static fields can either be: externally input, a Langmuir-Tonks model or from a Green’s Function (Boundary Element) based Poison Solver. Icarus has been used for subsonic to hypersonic, chemically reacting, and plasma flows.","2001-10-01","2020-03-07 02:26:24","2020-03-07 02:47:24","2020-03-07 02:26:24","SAND2001-2901, 789256","","","","","","Icarus","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.2172/789256","<p>Chapter 10.2 has a table of species-&gt;VHS parameters - super useful!</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/8JCY7Y43/Bartel et al. - 2001 - Icarus A 2-D Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC).pdf","","grade_a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SAND2001-2901, 789256","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adsorption isotherms of the dispersant on the alumina surface, electrophoretic mobility of the alumina particles as a function of the citric acid concentration, and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy of the citratealumina surface complex have been used. The adsorption behavior of citric acid is dependent on the pH of the suspension and the concentration of the citric acid. The maximum amount of citric acid adsorbed on the alumina surface, 2.17 μ.mol/m2 at pH 3, decreases to 1.17 μmol/m2 at pH 8. The adsorption of citrate causes a highly negatively charged powder surface and a shift of the isoelectric point (IEP) to lower pH values. The IEP of alumina can be fixed at any pH value between 9 and 3 by proper adjustment of the citric acid concentration. In situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of the citrate-alumina surface complex gives evidence for a direct interaction between the carboxylate groups of the citrate and the surface aluminum(III) atoms. The rheological properties of alumina suspensions are studied as a function of the citric acid concentration. The data obtained from the viscosity and dynamic electrophoretic measurements correlate well and allow the construction of a stability map of alumina suspensions stabilized with citric acid. The influence of citric acid on the viscosity is discussed using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The interaction potential between the particles is determined by the citrate adsorbed on the surface, leading to a negative particle charge, and the citrate anions remaining in the solution, resulting in an increase of the ionic strength. The adsorption of citric acid also creates a steric barrier that inhibits the complete mutual approach of the individual alumina particles.","1996","2020-03-07 05:57:46","2020-03-07 05:57:51","2020-03-07 05:57:46","1857-1867","","7","79","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08006.x","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/IGXGUTPB/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08006.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first examine the implementation of traditional relaxation algorithms for solving elliptic PDEs on meshconnected processor arrays, which require O ( N ) processors and O ( N ) computation time. The disadvantage of these implementations is that the determination of the acceleration factors requires some global communication at each iteration. The high communication cost increases the computation time per iteration significantly. Therefore, a local relaxation scheme is proposed to achieve the acceleration effect with very little global communication in the loading stage. We use a Fourier analysis approach to analyze the local relaxation method and also show its convergence. The convergence rate of the local relaxation method is studied by computer simulation.","1987-07","2020-03-08 23:17:33","2020-03-12 02:02:33","2020-03-08 23:17:33","550-573","","4","8","","SIAM J.

The LTCC thick film process is summarized including some unconventional process steps such as feature machining in the unfired state and thin film definition of outer layer conductors. The LTCC thick film process was characterized to optimize process yields by focusing on these factors: 1) Print location, 2) Print thickness, 3) Drying of tapes and panels, 4) Shrinkage upon firing, and 5) Via topography. Statistical methods were used to analyze critical process and product characteristics in the determination towards that optimization goal.","2016-05","2020-03-10 16:47:20","2020-03-10 16:47:20","2020-03-10 16:47:20","000142-000150","","CICMT","2016","","Additional Conferences (Device Packaging, HiTEC, HiTEN, & CICMT)","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/DR5P7IMV/Girardi et al. - 2016 - LTCC Thick Film Process Characterization.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ZIV998IS","journalArticle","","Sgobba, S","Materials for high vacuum technology: an overview","","","","","","In modern accelerators stringent requirements are placed on materials for vacuum systems. Their physical and mechanical properties, machinability, weldability, or brazeability are key parameters. Adequate strength, ductility, magnetic properties at room temperature as well as at low temperatures are important factors for vacuum systems of accelerators working at cryogenic temperatures, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) under construction at CERN. In addition, baking or activation of Non-Evaporable Getters (NEGs) at high temperatures imposes specific choices of material grades of suitable tensile and creep properties in a large temperature range. Today, stainless steels are the dominant materials of vacuum constructions. Their metallurgy is extensively treated here. The reasons for specific requirements in terms of metallurgical processes are detailed, in view of obtaining adequate purity, inclusion cleanliness, and fineness of the microstructure. In many cases these requirements are crucial to guarantee the final leak tightness of the vacuum components.","","2020-03-08 02:28:16","2020-03-12 02:34:01","","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/EFK2VM8Q/Sgobba - Materials for high vacuum technology an overview.pdf","","grade_a; refbase; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although possessing many advantages over the reciprocating compressors, one of the performance limitations of the rotary machines is their inferior mechanical efficiency due to the existence of large frictional losses, which occurs as a result of the high relative velocities between components in sliding contact. In efforts to effectively improve the mechanical efficiencies of rotary compressors, a new compressing mechanism has been developed which engages a radical concept of operation that is anticipated to produce a substantial reduction of the existing friction. A friction analysis taking into consideration the kinematics and dynamics of the novel machine is being conducted, where simulated results have revealed a superior mechanical efficiency as compared to other existing designs.","2006","2020-03-08 02:28:18","2020-03-12 01:59:59","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/6S7B5B5F/Teh and Ooi - 2006 - Design and Friction Analysis of the Revolving Vane.pdf","","grade_a; refbase; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research conducted at NASA-MSFC and Penn State –Applied Research Laboratory has shown that thermal conductivity of NARloy-Z can be increased significantly by adding diamonds to form a composite (NARloy-Z-D). NARloy-Z-D is also lighter than NARloy-Z. These attributes make this advanced composite material an ideal candidate for fabricating combustion chamber liner for an advanced rocket engine. Increased thermal conductivity will directly translate into increased turbopump power and increased chamber pressure for improved thrust and specific impulse. This paper describes the process development for fabricating a subscale high thermal conductivity NARloy-Z-D combustion chamber liner using Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST). The FAST process uses a mixture of NARloy-Z and diamond powders which is sintered under pressure at elevated temperatures. Several challenges were encountered, i.e., segregation of diamonds, machining the super hard NARloy-Z-D composite, net shape fabrication and nondestructive examination. The paper describes how these challenges were addressed. Diamonds coated with copper (CuD) appear to give the best results. A near net shape subscale combustion chamber liner is being fabricated by diffusion bonding cylindrical rings of NARloy-Z-CuD using the FAST process.","2016-01-04","2020-03-08 02:28:06","2020-03-12 01:58:44","2020-03-10 16:50:01","","","","","","","","","","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","San Diego, California, USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/DEBCJPWE/Bhat et al. - 2016 - Fabrication of High Thermal Conductivity NARloy-Z-.pdf","","grade_a; refbase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","57th AIAA/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significant effort has been made to develop electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that improve upon both computational speed and energy efficiency. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully-optical neural network that, using unique advantages of optics, promises a computational speed enhancement of at least two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art and three orders of magnitude in power efficiency for conventional learning tasks.

In this paper DSMC simulation of Poiseuille flow is made to evaluate the dependence of simulation results on cell dimension and number of particles per cell. In the simulation process a self adapting block structured grid system is employed to make sure that the number of particles per cell is constant. The simulation covers both slip flow regime and transition flow regime and each regime covers both high pressure and low pressure. Our simulation results indicate that the number of particles per cell and scaling factor exert little influence on simulation result for both slip flow and transition flow when the number of particles per cell surpasses 5, but the dimension of cell influences the accuracy of result obviously. The error caused by cell dimension decreases as the diminish of cell dimension. It is concluded that in the DSMC method it is necessary to make sure that the cell is less than 1/2 of molecular mean free path.","2009","2019-10-21 20:41:14","2020-03-12 01:55:20","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/BJVKGVSK/Sun et al. - 2009 - Proper Cell Dimension and Number of Particles Per .pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/QGDUSBA9/Sun et al. - 2009 - Proper Cell Dimension and Number of Particles Per .pdf","","grade_a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientiﬁc enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity.

However, its traditional reliance on a ﬁxed-resolution grid is not ideal for simulations that simultaneously exhibit both large and small-scale ﬂuid phenomena. Octreebased ﬂuid simulation approaches have provided the needed adaptivity, but the inherent weakness of a pointer-based tree structure has limited their eﬀectiveness. We present a linear octree structure that provides a signiﬁcant runtime speedup using these octree-based simulation algorithms. As memory prices continue to decline, we leverage additional memory when compared to traditional octree structures to provide this improvement. In addition to reducing the level of indirection in the data, because our linear octree is stored contiguously in memory as a simple C array rather than a recursive set of pointers, we provide a more cache-friendly data layout than a traditional octree. In our testing, our approach yielded run-times that were 1.5 to nearly 5 times faster than the same simulations running on a traditional octree implementation.","2018","2020-03-08 02:28:10","2020-03-12 02:32:41","2020-03-10 16:50:54","217-222","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Press","Bintan, Island, Indonesia","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/BCWVCAJ8/Flynn et al. - 2018 - Adaptive Fluid Simulation Using a Linear Octree St.pdf","","grade_a; refbase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Graphics International 2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contact angle progressed through the four wetting phases similar to other ceramics when the results were plotted on a logarithmic time scale. However, at and above 1273 K the equilibrium contact angle was 0° which is much less than those of typical ceramics. Using the value in phase II, the original contact angle between boron nitride and aluminum (contact angle between non-reacted boron nitride and aluminum) was estimated to be 133° at 1373 K. The wetting progressed by producing another non-wetting material, AIN, in this non-wetting system.

The process involves drying of the ‘green’ gelcast part before densiﬁcation. The physical mechanisms controlling this relatively long drying process are not well understood. In this study, several controlled experiments were performed to elucidate the key mechanisms. A one-dimensional drying model was formulated based on evaporation and gaseous diffusion through the part. Experimental data were used to obtain correlations for model parameters. This model predicts the instantaneous moisture content of a gelcast sample with an accuracy of better than 10% when dryer humidity and temperature, and sample thickness are speciﬁed.","","2020-03-10 16:50:57","2020-03-10 16:50:58","","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/YGLXKSQI/Ghosal et al. - A Physical Model for Drying of Gelcast Ceramics.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design of an efﬁcient multigrid solver is difﬁcult for these problems due to unpredictable inhomogeneity in the equation coefﬁcients and internal Dirichlet conditions with arbitrary location and value. We present a geometric multigrid approach to solving these systems designed around weighted prolongation/restriction operators and an appropriate system coarsening. This approach is compared against a modiﬁed incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient solver for a range of image sizes.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder and black plastic colour (BPC) were used to introduce scattering and absorption, respectively, in the phantoms. The optical absorption coefﬁcient (µa) at 1064 nm was determined using an optoacoustic method, while diffuse reﬂectance measurements were used to obtain the optical reduced scattering coefﬁcient (µs).

Hydrogels are formed by combining alginate with calcium carbonate (CaCO               3               ) particles and a photoacid generator (PAG). The PAG is photolyzed upon UV irradiation, resulting in the release of free calcium ions for ionic crosslinking. The viscous and elastic moduli during gelation are monitored as a function of the UV irradiation intensity, exposure time, alginate concentration, and the ratio between alginate and calcium carbonate. Gel time decreases as irradiation intensity increases because a larger concentration of PAG is photolyzed. Interestingly, dark curing, the continuing growth of microstructure in the absence of UV light, is observed. In some instances, the sample transitions from a solution to a gel during the dark curing phase. Additionally, when exposed to constant UV irradiation after the dark curing phase, samples reach the same plateau modulus as samples exposed to constant UV without dark curing, implying that dark curing does not affect the gelation mechanism. We believe the presence of dark curing is the result of the acidic environment persisting within the sample, allowing CaCO               3               to dissociate, thereby releasing free Ca               2+               ions capable of binding with the available appropriate ionic blocks of the polymer chains. The growth of microstructure is then detected if the activation barrier has been crossed to release sufficient calcium ions. In this regard, we calculate a value of 30 J that represents the activation energy required to initiate gelation.","2014","2020-03-08 02:28:12","2020-03-12 01:55:40","2020-03-10 16:51:42","4990-5002","","27","10","","Soft Matter","Photo-activated ionic gelation of alginate hydrogel","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/AVNDIB73/Higham et al. - 2014 - Photo-activated ionic gelation of alginate hydroge.pdf","","grade_a; refbase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The grafting of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was conducted by the trans-esterification reaction via introducing methacryloyl groups into PVA chains and glycidol was formed as by-product. The grafting reaction conditions of PVA-g-GMA e.g. GMA concentrations and reaction temperature were optimized. The kinetic parameters e.g. grafting efficiency (GE) and grafting percentage (GP%) were calculated to optimize the grafting reaction, while yield (%) was determined to monitor the hydrogels formation. The instrumental characterizations e.g. 1H-NMR, FTIR, SEM and TGA/DSC, were investigated for verifying the grafting reaction. The UV-photopolymerization was used for photocrosslinking the water-soluble PVA-g-GMA using Irgacure 2959 (I2959) as a photoinitiator. Results revealed that the grafting reaction dramatically increased with increase of both GMA concentration until 0.15M and reaction temperature at 60oC. Also, the surface morphological of PVA-g-GMA freeze-dried gels was found more compacted, smooth and uniform due to the grafting process. A significant thermal stability was noticed, due to grafting reaction of PVA-g-GMA throughout TGA and DSC results. The obtained results are very promising and opening new area for conducting further investigations considering the very low price of the used UV crosslinking method compared to the chemical crosslinking method.","2018","2020-03-10 16:51:45","2020-03-10 16:51:45","2020-03-10 16:51:45","","","","","","J App Pharm Sci","In-Situ UV-Photopolymerized PVA-g-GMA Hydrogels for Biomedical Applications","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VZ3MLZ4M/2018 - In-Situ UV-Photopolymerized PVA-g-GMA Hydrogels fo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SLPIC thus offers more feasible, fully kinetic simulation in regimes that historically have required fluid approaches, such as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), two-fluid, or Boltzmann electron treatments. In particular, SLPIC allows an explicit time advance with steps much larger than the inverse plasma frequency, avoiding the instability explicit PIC faces with large timesteps. SLPIC avoids this instability by slowing down fast particles (e.g., electrons) in a way that is rigorously underpinned by an approximate Vlasov equation; unlike MHD, two-fluid, and Boltzmann electron approaches, SLPIC does not fundamentally neglect any first-principles plasma physics, although the choices of grid cell size, timestep, and number of macroparticles per cell naturally limit the physical phenomena that can be accurately represented. SLPIC can be implemented with minor modifications of a standard PIC code and does not require an implicit time advance. It enables large timesteps in first-principles kinetic plasma simulation of appropriately slow phenomena, and it can handle many of the same complications as PIC, such as boundary conditions and collisions. In an argon plasma sheath test problem, a SLPIC simulation achieved a speed-up of a factor of 160 over the corresponding PIC simulation, without loss of accuracy.","2019-01-07","2020-03-08 02:28:19","2020-03-10 16:59:00","2020-03-10 16:52:27","","","","","","","Speeding Up Simulations By Slowing Down Particles","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1511.08225","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/MZRIJEIJ/Werner et al_2018_Speeding up simulations by slowing down particles.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/A9RWQT2U/Werner et al. - 2019 - Speeding Up Simulations By Slowing Down Particles.pdf","","grade_a; refbase; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach employs a multigrid cycle as a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method, which enables the use of a lightweight, purely geometric multigrid scheme while drastically improving convergence and robustness on irregular domains. Our method is designed for parallel execution on shared-memory platforms and poses modest requirements in terms of bandwidth and memory footprint. Our solver will accommodate as many as 7682×1152 voxels with a memory footprint less than 16GB, while a full smoke simulation at this resolution ﬁts in 32GB of RAM. Our preconditioned conjugate gradient solver typically reduces the residual by one order of magnitude every 2 iterations, while each PCG iteration requires approximately 6.1sec on a 16-core SMP at 7683 resolution. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our method on animations of smoke ﬂow past solid objects and free surface water animations using Poisson pressure projection at unprecedented resolutions.","","2020-03-10 16:52:34","2020-03-10 16:52:34","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/KD3X643I/McAdams et al. - A parallel multigrid Poisson solver for ﬂuids simu.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it has been discovered that ceramics may contain multiple different grain boundary phases (complexions) that are chemically induced by certain additives. These complexions are useful in explaining a number of anomalous phenomena associated with sintering, such as abnormal grain growth. The current work investigates how transitions between these complexions occur and at which grain boundaries they are most likely to occur. The number of complexion transitions that occur increases linearly with grain size (grain boundary excess concentration), and exponentially with temperature. The results suggest that grain boundary energy and anisotropy are important in predicting which and how many grain boundaries will undergo such a transition.","2008-01","2020-03-10 16:52:44","2020-03-10 16:52:44","2020-03-10 16:52:44","1485-1493","","7","28","","Journal of the European Ceramic Society","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/APZ5JCHK/Dillon and Harmer - 2008 - Demystifying the role of sintering additives with .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MUIJIVPT","journalArticle","","Maixner, Michael; Parker, William","Design Of A Multi Mode Finite Difference Heat Transfer Project","","","","","","The development of a comprehensive inite-difference project at the end of a heat transfer curriculum is described. The problem requires evaluation of the school’s football ield turf heating system, incorporates all of the major heat transfer modes (convection, conduction, and radiation), and requires students to investigate both steady state and transient versions of the problem, with comparison to analytical solutions when available. The problem is solved using the inite-difference method (FDM) and an Excel™ spreadsheet with Visual Basic for Applications™ (VBA) programming to facilitate program execution beyond normal spreadsheet capabilities. The project also requires students to conduct a design analysis for environmental and/or system changes, subject to approval by the instructor; suggested topics for this design project are offered. The project is designed so that it is easy for students to understand, and recommendations are offered regarding project design and submission which facilitate grading of student work. While the speciic application described herein is to the school’s football ield, the same approach may be employed in many steady state and transient heat transfer problems—in fact, students have employed the modeling and programming techniques learned in this project to other courses, including their Senior Capstone projects. Results of a student opinion survey, anecdotal data, and performance on the heat transfer portion of the Fundamentals of Engineering examination data are presented.","","2020-03-08 02:28:15","2020-03-12 01:59:56","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/DV5TRGMA/Maixner and Parker - Design Of A Multi Mode Finite Difference Heat Tran.pdf","","grade_a; refbase; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only can compliance with a set of rules having little impact on the number of faults be considered wasted effort, but it can actually result in an increase in faults, as any modiﬁcation has a non-zero probability of introducing a fault or triggering a previously concealed one. Therefore, it is important to build a body of empirical knowledge, helping us understand which rules are worthwhile enforcing, and which ones should be ignored in the context of fault reduction.

Obtaining samples that remain superelastic and exhibit desired precurvatures currently requires many iterations, which is time consuming and consumes a substantial amount of Nitinol. To provide a more accurate and reliable method of shape setting, in this paper we propose an electrical technique that uses Joule heating to attain the necessary shape setting temperatures. The resulting high power heating prevents unintended aging of the material and yields consistent and accurate results for the rapid creation of prototypes. We present a complete algorithm and system together with an experimental analysis of temperature regulation. We experimentally validate the approach on Nitinol tubes that are shape set into planar curves. We also demonstrate the feasibility of creating general space curves by shape setting a helical tube. The system demonstrates a mean absolute temperature error of 10°C.","2016-01","2020-03-08 02:28:10","2020-03-12 01:55:09","2020-03-10 16:53:36","98-105","","1","1","","IEEE Robot. Autom.

The developed ES-PIC solver is validated for capacitively coupled plasma, its AMR capabilities are demonstrated for simulations of streamer development during high-pressure gas breakdown.

Proﬁles of the electric potential, electric ﬁeld and space charge density are found to vary systematically with the pressure p and magnetic ﬁeld strength B , in a way which corresponds to a transition from the usual positive space charge mode at low values of B /p to a higher impedance negative space charge mode at higher values of B /p. This is consistent with a continuous and considerable reduction in the ratio of the electron-to-ion classical cross-ﬁeld transport coefﬁcients with increasing B /p.

Therefore, fundamental knowledge on transmission routes that could be used to improve intervention strategies is still missing.

Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests. Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible. In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses. Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus. By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection. In contrast to in vitro examinations, the results of these tests allow use recommendations of chemical disinfectants for outbreak situations and daily routine disinfection.","2004-04-01","2020-03-10 18:57:28","2020-05-10 22:27:38","2020-03-10 18:57:28","49-54","","","56","","Journal of Hospital Infection","","The 7th International BODE Hygiene Days","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<blockquote> <p>Since viruses are quite different from bacteria, inactivation results based upon bacteriological studies cannot be applied to viruses.</p> </blockquote> <p> </p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/48TFPY9A/Steinmann - 2004 - Surrogate viruses for testing virucidal efficacy o.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RPLJRCCQ/S0195670103005188.html","","Barfuss_Book_Club","HBV; HCV; Norovirus; Surrogate viruses; Virucidal efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces. Methods: The efﬁcacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/ p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71% ethanol). Results: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log10 reduction factor of 3.2 for 70% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71% ethanol. For MHV, log10 reduction factors were 3.9 for 70% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71% ethanol. Conclusion: Only ethanol reduced infectivity of the 2 coronaviruses by .3-log10 after 1 minute.

The most common expressions of the L-J potential are                                   V                        LJ                             =         4         ε                    [                                                        (                                                         σ                     r                                                     )                                               12                                         −                                             (                                                         σ                     r                                                     )                                               6                                                  ]                  =         ε                    [                                                        (                                                                                r                                                m                                                                 r                                                     )                                               12                                         −             2                                             (                                                                                r                                                m                                                                 r                                                     )                                               6                                                  ]                  ,                 {\displaystyle V_{\text{LJ}}=4\varepsilon \left[\left({\frac {\sigma }{r}}\right)^{12}-\left({\frac {\sigma }{r}}\right)^{6}\right]=\varepsilon \left[\left({\frac {r_{\text{m}}}{r}}\right)^{12}-2\left({\frac {r_{\text{m}}}{r}}\right)^{6}\right],}   where ε is the depth of the potential well, σ is the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero, r is the distance between the particles, and rm is the distance at which the potential reaches its minimum. At rm, the potential function has the value −ε. The distances are related as rm = 21/6σ ≈ 1.122σ. These parameters can be fitted to reproduce experimental data or accurate quantum chemistry calculations. Due to its computational simplicity, the Lennard-Jones potential is used extensively in computer simulations even though more accurate potentials exist.","2020-02-25","2020-03-11 23:08:35","2020-03-11 23:08:43","2020-03-11 23:08:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 942626578","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/6RRGZGKI/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was the intent of this study to determine whether HTST pasteurization conducted in a continuous-flow pasteurizer that simulates commercial operation would enhance FMDV inactivation in milk. Cows were inoculated in the mammary gland with the field strain of FMDV (01/UK). Infected raw whole milk and 2% milk were then pasteurized using an Arm-field pilot-scale, continuous-flow HTST pasteurizer equipped with a plate-and-frame heat exchanger and a holding tube. The milk samples, containing FMDV at levels of up to 104 plaque-forming units/mL, were pasteurized at temperatures ranging from 72 to 95°C at holding times of either 18.6 or 36s. Pasteurization decreased virus infectivity by 4 log10 to undetectable levels in tissue culture. However, residual infectivity was still detectable for selected pasteurized milk samples, as shown by intramuscular and intradermal inoculation of milk into naïve steers. Although HTST pasteurization did not completely inactivate viral infectivity in whole and 2% milk, possibly because a fraction of the virus was protected by the milk fat and the casein proteins, it greatly reduced the risk of natural transmission of FMDV by milk.","2007-07-01","2020-03-14 14:08:37","2020-03-14 14:08:37","2020-03-14 14:08:37","3202-3211","","7","90","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p><span style=""box-sizing: border-box;

Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly.","2006-01-01","2020-03-14 16:26:43","2020-03-14 16:26:43","2020-03-14 16:26:43","193-292","","","66","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/S0065-3527(06)66005-3","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RVTL7BIY/Masters - 2006 - The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/I68W6FLE/S0065352706660053.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus of this study was to evaluate the inactivation efficiency (IE) achieved through filtration coupled with microwave irradiation. MS2 aerosolized through a Collison nebulizer was fed into the system and collected onto the filter. For in-flight microwave decontamination, microwave irradiation was applied to an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) filter supported on a SiC disk for three cycles of selected irradiation times per 10 min (i.e., 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min/10 min) at power levels ranging from 125 W to 375 W. The survival fraction (SF) on the substrate and the IE through the entire system were investigated to determine the efficacy of this approach. SF decreased and IE increased as microwave power level was increased (p = 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively) or the application time was extended (p = 0.03 and p < 0.01, respectively). Both measures changed sharply above a threshold temperature of around 90°C and reached 2 logs at 116 and 109°C, respectively. The log SF and IE of –2.59 and 3.62, respectively, were observed when the operating condition of 375 W for 10 min/cycle was used and the SiC disk facilitated microwave absorption. When a quartz frit was used as a support instead of the SiC disk, log inactivation efficiencies of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3 were measured at relative humidities of 30%, 60% and 90%, respectively, under the same irradiation conditions. Relative humidity is a significant parameter from 50–80°C (p = 0.01). The results demonstrate that microwave-assisted filtration systems can be used as an effective means for inactivating viruses.","2012","2020-03-14 19:21:28","2020-03-14 19:21:28","2020-03-14 19:21:28","295-303","","3","12","","Aerosol Air Qual.

Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

Epidemiological studies of outbreaks have suggested that vomiting facilitates transmission of human NoV, but there have been no laboratory-based studies characterizing the degree of NoV release during a vomiting event. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that virus aerosolization occurs in a simulated vomiting event, and to estimate the amount of virus that is released in those aerosols. A simulated vomiting device was constructed at one-quarter scale of the human body following similitude principles. Simulated vomitus matrices at low (6.24 mPa*s) and high (177.5 mPa*s) viscosities were inoculated with low (108 PFU/mL) and high (1010 PFU/mL) concentrations of bacteriophage MS2 and placed in the artificial “stomach” of the device, which was then subjected to scaled physiologically relevant pressures associated with vomiting. Bio aerosols were captured using an SKC Biosampler. In low viscosity artificial vomitus, there were notable differences between recovered aerosolized MS2 as a function of pressure (i.e., greater aerosolization with increased pressure), although this was not always statistically significant. This relationship disappeared when using high viscosity simulated vomitus. The amount of MS2 aerosolized as a percent of total virus “vomited” ranged from 7.2 x 10-5 to 2.67 x 10-2 (which corresponded to a range of 36 to 13,350 PFU total). To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and measure aerosolization of a NoV surrogate in a similitude-based physical model. This has implications for better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection control measures.","2015-08-19","2020-03-15 20:49:50","2020-03-15 20:49:50","2020-03-15 20:49:50","e0134277","","8","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/3RBZXBCH/article.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/QNWFJSQM/Tung-Thompson et al_2015_Aerosolization of a Human Norovirus Surrogate, Bacteriophage MS2, during.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While phages are commonly isolated first and subsequently characterized, it is possible to alter isolation procedures to bias the isolation toward phages with desirable characteristics. Some of these variations are regularly used by some groups while others have only been shown in a few publications.

Ozone is a very effective disinfectant for viruses and has distinct benefits over other forms of disinfectants, in that it increases the clarity of water and can oxidize some chemical contaminants in water. However, because of the combination of high ozone demand of most wastewaters and rapid reaction with viruses, determination of ozone dose in wastewater and recycled water treatment is not well defined. While various surrogates are used as indicator organisms for human pathogenic viruses in water reuse practice, much less is known about the relationship between surrogates and human pathogenic viruses for ozone disinfection in wastewater. In this study, the ozone inactivation dose response of several surrogates (Escherichia coli, coliphage T1, T4, PRD-1, ΦX174, and MS2) and human pathogenic viruses (poliovirus 1, echovirus 11, coxsackievirus B5, and adenovirus 2) were compared for the first time in secondary effluent wastewater. A unique reduction equivalent dose method was proposed to compare the inactivation of the microorganisms studied across waters with varying ozone demand. Inactivation of all viruses and surrogates studied was greater than 4 log at ozone Ct levels of less than 1 (mg/L)-min. E. coli and PRD-1 were identified as conservative surrogates for indicating inactivation of human pathogenic viruses in ozone disinfection of wastewater, providing a tool for practitioners and regulators to confidently accept ozonation systems for virus inactivation in wastewater reuse.","2015-04-13","2020-03-15 23:44:47","2020-03-15 23:44:47","2020-03-15 23:44:47","451-460","","6","32","","Environmental Engineering Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","liebertpub.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/568GGNKI/ees.2014.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identified only one study documenting surface disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a >6.6 log reduction after 5-minute exposure to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small-scale tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus.","2017-05-22","2020-03-16 00:04:55","2020-05-10 22:27:34","2020-03-16 00:04:55","","","5","12","","PLoS One","Selection of a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) surrogate to evaluate surface disinfection efficacy in Ebola outbreaks","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 28531182 PMCID: PMC5439676","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/6EL3WKBF/Gallandat_Lantagne_2017_Selection of a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) surrogate to evaluate surface.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439676/","Barfuss_Book_Club","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent revolutionary technical advances in imaging, sequencing and lipid analysis have significantly boosted the depth and volume of knowledge on these viruses. This has resulted in new concepts of virus assembly, understanding of virion stability and dynamics, and the description of novel processes for viral genome packaging and membrane-driven genome delivery to the host. The detailed analyses of such processes have given novel insights into DNA transport across the protein-rich lipid bilayer and the transformation of spherical membrane structures into tubular nanotubes, resulting in the description of unexpectedly dynamic functions of the membrane structures. Membrane-containing phages have provided a framework for understanding virus evolution. The original observation on membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD1 and human pathogenic adenovirus has been fundamental in delineating the concept of “viral lineages”, postulating that the fold of the major capsid protein can be used as an evolutionary fingerprint to trace long-distance evolutionary relationships that are unrecognizable from the primary sequences. This has brought the early evolutionary paths of certain eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal viruses together, and potentially enables the reorganization of the nearly immeasurable virus population (~1 × 1031) on Earth into a reasonably low number of groups representing different architectural principles.

Compared to the cost of a new centrifuge (priced by a fellow Thingiversian at $500 minimum on Froogle), a Dremelfuge is incredibly cheap. It can be used for DIYbio ( http://www.diybio.org ) or for some culinary uses. It requires industry standard 1.5ml/2ml Eppendorf/Microcentrifuge tubes. Used with a drill at 3000 RPM, the Dremelfuge will deliver over 400g, enough to comfortably spin down Miniprep samples (proven personally). It will likely achieve acceptable results at lower speeds, too. Used at 10krpm, on a Rotary tool for instance, a Dremelfuge should deliver over 4400g, more than enough to spin down bacterial cells. At 16krpm, Dremelfuge matches commercial centrifuges. On a Dremel 300, a maximum speed of 33krpm equates to a force of over 50,000 times earth's gravity, which puts it into so-called ""Ultracentrifuge"" territory. The latest version (as printed by Shapeways) has successfully spun tubes at this speed. To see some picures of Dremelfuge used to spin down cells, see here:http://letters.cunningprojects.com/?p=85 Quick Video Intro to Dremelfuge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86WnXeTZO_Y (Update: This video hit over 1900 views! Thanks Makezine/Bre!) A video of me using Dremelfuge practically in a tent, to extract DNA from a banana: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnyFwupk5KA Dremelfuge is available for sale as a high-quality, robust print on Shapeways.com in two editions, each suited for up to six samples at a time: Dremelfuge Recessed Edition, to fit the cutting-tool-holder commonly found with rotary tools (5mm diameter bore), and Dremelfuge Chuck Edition, which can be quickly adapted for use in any machine with a chuck grip. They are both available here on my Shapeways shop:http://shapeways.com/shops/labsfromfabs Dremelfuge, as with any high-speed rotary tool, may cause personal harm or damage to property or persons in case of failure, and no guarantee, warranty, promise or suggestion of safety is made or offered by me (Cathal Garvey) with regard to DremelFuge.

Studies have found a relationship among temperature, humidity, and influenza virus incidence, transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity. Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets. Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high (>85%) and low (<60%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (∼60 to 85%). At an AH of less than 22 g · m-3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g · m-3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude. At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19°C and 25°C. We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity. The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets. This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets.IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses are responsible for a number of infectious diseases resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year in the United States. There has been a lively debate in the literature over whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) modulates virus infectivity. We designed a controlled study and used advanced statistical modeling techniques specifically to address this question. By providing an improved understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and virus infectivity, our work will ultimately lead to improved strategies for predicting and controlling disease transmission.","2018","2020-03-18 00:09:01","2020-03-18 00:09:04","","","","12","84","","Appl.

Fouts J. Craig Venter Institute, Rockville, MD","","","","","","There are an estimated 1031 bacteriophages (phage), viruses that infect bacteria, on earth, thus comprising a significant portion of the biosphere. Of these, a mere 10,733 phages have been isolated and 2,061 phages have sequenced, complete genomes, with even fewer, only 1,073, presently publicly available in the NCBI GenBank database. “Phagehunting” is the process of isolation, characterization, and genomic analyses of phages that infect bacterial hosts. There is considerable interest in using phages as diagnostics and therapeutics of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. One such MDR bacterium is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, whose phages can be isolated on the easy-to-grow non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. Since current phagehunting procedures of Mycobacterium phages all use identical plating conditions, we would like to explore alternative phagehunting procedures to determine if that affects the type of phages isolated. To date, no phages within the Podoviridae family have been isolated that infect Mycobacteria. With these new optimized procedures, we would like to pilot a program, contingent on the success of this study, to expose high school students to the field of molecular and synthetic genomics. We examined the precise conditions required in each step of the phagehunting process to successfully obtain phage. With the use of careful phage isolation procedures and environmental samples from various locations, such as alternative media usage and modified plaque-picking methods, we isolated potentially novel phages. One of these phages, Kalon1, has been isolated and preliminarily characterized. The success of this study may provide the foundation for an improved program for high school students to foster their interest in research and gain invaluable experiences outside of the classroom while providing bacteriophages that can serve as the base chassis of synthetically engineered phages for diagnosis and treatment of MDR pathogens. Lastly, by creating a generalizable standardized process to obtain phages, we may broaden the horizon for new exploration of novel phages and advances in phage therapy of any MDR pathogen.","","2020-03-18 02:25:29","2020-03-18 02:25:52","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/CHUT5V5F/ShriyaPoster.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For some applications the sensitivity of the QCM sensors typically used (5–20 MHz) is limited compared with other biosensor methods. In this study ultrasensitive QCM sensors with resonant frequencies from 39 to 110 MHz for measurements in the liquid phase are presented. The fundamental sensor effect of a QCM is the decrease of the resonant frequency of an oscillating quartz crystal due to the binding of mass on a coated surface during the measurement. The sensitivity of QCM sensors increases strongly with an increasing resonant frequency and, therefore, with a decreasing thickness of the sensitive area. The new kind of ultrasensitive QCM sensors used in this study is based on chemically milled shear mode quartz crystals which are etched only in the center of the blank, forming a thin quartz membrane with a thick, mechanically stable outer ring. An immunoassay using a virus specific monoclonal antibody and a M13-Phage showed an increase in the signal to noise ratio by a factor of more than 6 for 56 MHz quartz crystals compared with standard 19 MHz quartz crystals, the detection limit was improved by a factor of 200. Probing of acoustic properties of glycerol/water mixtures resulted in an increase in sensitivity, which is in very good agreement with theory. Chemically milled QCM sensors strongly improve the sensitivity in biosensing and probing of acoustic properties and, therefore, offer interesting new application fields for QCM sensors.","2001-12-01","2020-03-18 15:34:55","2020-03-18 15:34:55","2020-03-18 15:34:55","735-743","","9","16","","Biosensors and Bioelectronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/4H2QZ563/S0956566301002202.html","","","Acoustic properties; Bacteriophage M13; High fundamental frequency; Quartz crystal microbalance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taken together, the resulting values are most compatible with triangulation numbers T = 13 and Q = 21 for both T2 and T4, thus confirming the previously proposed capsid architecture of T4 revealed by indirect measurements and thereby eliminating the repeatedly reported discrepancy between T2 and T4 in favor of a common Q number of 21 corresponding to 960 copies of gp23*.","1988-06","2020-03-18 19:33:08","2020-03-18 19:33:08","","189-202","","3","99","","J.

Motivated by the elastic network model, proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model, including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular assemblies of unknown atomic structure.","2007-04-04","2020-03-19 05:37:29","2020-05-10 22:25:05","2020-03-19 05:37:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 0704.0634","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/KMSHW9J5/Bathe - 2007 - A Finite Element framework for computation of prot.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/XYNAQNTW/0704.html","","⛔ No DOI found; Barfuss_Book_Club","Quantitative Biology - Biomolecules; Quantitative Biology - Quantitative Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With this aim, both biocomponents have been immobilised in parallel onto interdigitated gold microelectrodes. The produced surfaces have been characterised by EIS and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy and have been applied to bacteria detection. Compared to immunocapture, detection using phages generates successive dual signals of opposite trend over time, which consist of an initial increase in impedance caused by bacteria capture followed by impedance decrease attributed to phage-induced lysis. Such dual signals can be easily distinguished from those caused by non-speciﬁc adsorption and/or crossbinding, which helps to circumvent one of the main drawbacks of reagentless biosensors based in a single target-binding event. The described strategy has generated speciﬁc detection of Escherichia coli in the range of 104–107 CFU mL−1 and minimal interference by non-target Lactobacillus.

This study was confirmed by measuring the microwave absorption spectra of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), which is a rod-shaped virus. This is also the first study to identify the “dipolar-like” mode in a rod-shaped nano-object. Our study is not only an important step to achieve rapid and sensitive detection of rod-shaped viruses based on their microwave spectroscopic features and a non-contact method to measure the Young’s modulus of rod-shaped viruses, but also is critical to formulate an efficient epidemic prevention strategy to deactivate viruses with the structure-resonant microwaves.","2017-07-04","2020-03-19 05:51:18","2020-05-10 22:19:07","2020-03-19 05:51:18","1-9","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VHUJZTRY/Sun et al. - 2017 - Resonant Dipolar Coupling of Microwaves with Confi.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/GLVK3LLR/s41598-017-04089-7.html","","Barfuss_Book_Club","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tubes represent nearly a tenfold reduction in dimensions as compared with conventional receiving tubes, but compare favorably with them in transconductance and amplification factor. The interelectrode capacitances are only a fraction of those obtained in the larger tubes. The triodes have been operated in a conventional feed-back oscillator circuit at a wavelength of 30 centimeters with a plate voltage of 115 volts and a plate current of 3 milliamperes.

The SMO is a compact, rugged and lightweight terahertz source capable of operating in the nearly unexplored near- and far-infrared electromagnetic spectrum. It will provide high power, highly efficient THz radiation for active illumination and/or local oscillators for applications in compact sensor arrays for THz imaging. Civilian applications of these devices include high-resolution radar, satellite telecommunications, remote sensing, line-of-sight networking, plasma and solid-state diagnostics, and high-speed computing. Other military applications of the SMO include line-of-sight networking and communications as well as chemical and biological spectroscopy. In the SMO, a tiny electron beam produced by a micron-sized cold-cathode interacts with the millimeter-wave fields of a miniature multi-vane cylindrical microcavity where the beam, as it rotates about the cavity axis, generates a terahertz signal inside the microcavity. The highly desirable features of the SMO, such as high power and its miniature size, make for an ultrahigh frequency vacuum microtube that has the potential to revolutionize the millimeter-wave tube industry. Once fully developed, the SMO should represent a multi-million dollar market.","2009-01-30","2020-03-20 06:43:17","2020-03-20 06:43:18","2020-03-20 06:43:17","","","","","","","Miniature Sub-Millimeter Wave Magnetron Oscillator","","","","","Defense Technical Information Center","Fort Belvoir, VA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.21236/ADA533571","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/NJAM9SEX/a533571.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The films deposited on the Pyrex glass substrate were polycrystalline and c-axis oriented. A minimum film resistivity gave 28.2 Ω cm at an annealing temperature of 525°C. The temperature dependence of the conductivity indicated electron transport in the conduction band due to thermal excitation of donor electrons for temperatures from 250 to 300 K. The grain boundary scattering effect due to thermionic emission was confirmed. For temperatures below 250 K nearest-neighbor hopping conduction was dominant in the films. The films were transparent in the visible range above 400 nm and had sharp ultraviolet absorption edges at 380 nm.

The modified oil was subsequently used as the polyol component in the formulation of rigid polyurethane foams. Wood flour was chosen to be incorporated as filler in these materials. Physical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the neat and reinforced foams were measured, analyzed, and compared to a reference commercial system. The chemical reaction between wood flour and isocyanate strongly affected the composites’ response to thermo-gravimetric tests. Compression modulus and yield strength decreased as wood flour content increased.

It influences calculus formation and periodontal disease. Different studies have been done to find exact correlation of salivary biomarkers with periodontal disease. With a multitude of biomarkers and complexities in their determination, the salivary pH may be tried to be used as a quick chairside test. The aim of this study was to analyze the pH of saliva and determine its relevance to the severity of periodontal disease. Study Design: The study population consisted of 300 patients. They were divided into three groups of 100 patients each: Group A had clinically healthy gingiva, Group B who had generalized chronic gingivitis and Group C who had generalized chronic periodontitis. The randomized unstimulated saliva from each patient was collected and pH was tested. Data was analyzed statistically using analysis of variance technique. Results: The salivary pH was more alkaline for patients with generalized chronic gingivitis as compared with the control group (P = 0.001) whereas patients with generalized chronic periodontitis had more acidic pH as compared with the control group (P = 0.001). Conclusion: These results indicate a significant change in the pH depending on the severity of the periodontal condition. The salivary pH shows significant changes and thus relevance to the severity of periodontal disease. Salivary pH may thus be used as a quick chairside diagnostic biomarker.","2013","2020-03-22 16:42:28","2020-03-22 16:42:30","2020-03-22 16:42:28","461-465","","4","17","","J Indian Soc Periodontol","Salivary pH","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24174725 PMCID: PMC3800408","","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800408/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ion distribution demonstrated two types of the local regions on the inner surface of the capsid’s wall: highly occupied with chloride ions in both systems despite a largely uniform electrostatic potential everywhere on the surface, and the regions that loose almost all chloride ions in the unstable capsid.

The increasing frequency and magnitude of viral outbreaks in recent decades has resulted in an urgent need for diagnostic methods that are facile, sensitive, rapid and inexpensive. Here, we describe and characterise a novel, calcium-mediated interaction of the surface of enveloped viruses with DNA, that can be used for the functionalisation of intact virus particles via chemical groups attached to the DNA. Using DNA modified with fluorophores, we have demonstrated the rapid and sensitive labelling and detection of influenza and other viruses using single-particle tracking and particle-size determination. With this method, we have detected clinical isolates of influenza in just one minute, significantly faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests. This powerful technique is easily extendable to a wide range of other enveloped pathogenic viruses and holds significant promise as a future diagnostic tool.","2019-11-07","2020-03-22 23:56:20","2020-03-22 23:56:20","2020-03-22 23:56:20","1-13","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/43TSES2A/Robb et al_2019_Rapid functionalisation and detection of viruses via a novel Ca 2+ -mediated.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/Y5PDCTXZ/s41598-019-52759-5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of concentration of solids (10–18%) and time (0–75 min) of processing on textural attributes, and viscoelasticity were investigated along with sensory attributes. The textural attribute determined is gel strength, while viscoelasticity was determined in terms of mechanical spectra like storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), complex viscosity (η*) and loss factor (tan δ) during a frequency sweep varying from 0.01 to 40 Hz at a constant stress of 25 Pa. Microstructural observation indicates the swelling of starch granules in the beginning of heating, while damaged granule and leached-out materials are visible at the end of the gelling process. Desirability function analysis has been applied to obtain a rice gel with acceptable textural attributes; a solid concentration of 15.2% and a heating time of 75 min can lead to the development of a gel with a satisfaction level of 0.6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Rice flour gels in the form of hard-set gels, porridges and spreads are popular in several parts of the world particularly for feeding of infants and children. The application of the present study lies in understanding the role of major processing variables on the quality attributes and viscoelasticity of a product, characterization of cooked gels and for developing rice flour-based food gels.

Non-uniform and differential drying in various regions due to the solvent gradient, induces structural and residual stresses which cause defects, such as cracking, warpage, bending and the other malformations, which make the articles useless. These malformations can be minimised or eliminated by using the liquid desiccant drying method due to the release of residual stresses. In this work, gelcast green parts have been brought in contact with an appropriate liquid desiccant with the purpose of withdrawing above 30 wt.% solvent in a reasonable period of time, i.e. 3 h. The effects of factors such as loading level of ceramic powders, liquid desiccant concentration and its gradient, effective thickness and geometry of parts and type of liquid desiccant solution (aqueous or non-aqueous), on the drying rate were studied. Lower solid content in the gel, higher liquid desiccant concentration and lower effective thickness of parts, increase the drying rate. Decrease of aspect ratio in cylindrical parts changes the diffusion mechanism from radial to longitudinal direction. Drying of parts in aqueous solution of PEG1000 is more homogeneous than the non-aqueous one, but drying rate of parts in non-aqueous solution of PEG1000 is greater than the aqueous one.","2003-12-01","2020-03-24 17:18:37","2020-03-24 17:18:37","2020-03-24 17:18:37","2265-2272","","13","23","","Journal of the European Ceramic Society","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/4GNC7PMU/S0955221903000451.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a principal indicator of water quality, sensitive to any suspended solids present. Prior work has identified the lack of low-cost turbidity monitoring as a significant hurdle to overcome to improve water quality in many domains, especially in the developing world. Low-cost hand-held benchtop meters have been proposed. This work adapts and verifies the technology for continuous monitoring. Lab tests show the low-cost continuous monitor can achieve 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) accuracy in the range 0–100 NTU and costs approximately 64 USD in components to construct. This level of accuracy yields useful and actionable data about water quality and may be sufficient in certain applications where cost is a primary constraint. A 38-day continuous monitoring trial, including a step change in turbidity, showed promising results with a median error of 0.45 and 1.40 NTU for two different monitors. However, some noise was present in the readings resulting in a standard deviation of 1.90 and 6.55 NTU, respectively. The cause was primarily attributed to ambient light and bubbles in the piping. By controlling these noise sources, we believe the low-cost continuous turbidity monitor could be a useful tool in multiple domains.","2019-07-10","2020-03-24 22:23:31","2020-03-24 22:23:33","2020-03-24 22:23:31","","","14","19","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 31295890 PMCID: PMC6679002","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/YG9I6A7N/Gillett_Marchiori_2019_A Low-Cost Continuous Turbidity Monitor.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679002/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It explains how this approach can be used in the simulation and modeling of condensed phase and biomolecular systems. Each chapter focuses on specific examples of evolving coarse-graining methodologies and presents results for a variety of complex systems. The contributors carefully detail their own coarse-graining approach, exploring its motivation, strengths, weaknesses, and important application examples. They discuss two of the most successful coarse-graining schemes for soft matter: inverse and multiscale coarse-graining. The book also describes current coarse-grained model development for peptides and proteins at the amino acid level and larger length scales. Assembling the work of some of the most influential, world-renowned researchers in the field, this book provides a unified, in-depth overview of all the coarse-grained schemes developed for condensed phase and biomolecular systems. It shows the promise of coarse-graining as a revolutionary advancement in the scientific community.","2008-09-22","2020-03-25 22:47:28","2020-03-25 22:47:28","","","492","","","","","","","","","","CRC Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: skNKAXfeXUMC","","","https://books.google.ca/books?id=skNKAXfeXUMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have applied methods primarily based on atomic force microscopy and finite element modeling that allow precise investigation of the mechanical properties of the influenza virus lipid envelope. The mechanical properties of small, spherical vesicles made from PR8 influenza lipids were probed by an atomic force microscopy tip applying forces up to 0.2 nN, which led to an elastic deformation up to 20%, on average. The liposome deformation was modeled using finite element methods to extract the lipid bilayer elastic properties. We found that influenza liposomes were softer than what would be expected for a gel phase bilayer and highly deformable: Consistent with previous suggestion that influenza lipids do not undergo a major phase transition, we observe that the stiffness of influenza liposomes increases gradually and weakly (within one order of magnitude) with temperature. Surprisingly, influenza liposomes were, in most cases, able to withstand wall-to-wall deformation, and forces >1 nN were generally required to puncture the influenza envelope, which is similar to viral protein shells. Hence, the choice of a highly flexible lipid envelope may provide as efficient a protection for a viral genome as a stiff protein shell.","2011-02-02","2020-03-26 04:13:15","2020-05-10 22:26:55","2020-03-26 04:13:15","637-645","","3","100","","Biophys J","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 21281578 PMCID: PMC3030173","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/8WZH648J/Li et al_2011_Bending and Puncturing the Influenza Lipid Envelope.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3030173/","Barfuss_Book_Club","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with the native GRF and GRS, the water-holding ability of modified GRF and GRS were enhanced. Both the onset and peak temperatures of the modified samples increased while the endothermic enthalpy change decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, dry heating remarkably increased the apparent viscosities of both GRF and GRS. Importantly, compared with GRS samples, the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G"") values of modified GRF increased more greatly and the tanδ values decreased more remarkably, indicating that the dry-heat treatment showed more impact on the GRF and a higher viscoelasticity compared with GRS. Our results suggest the dry-heat treatment of GRF is a more effective method than that of GRS, which omits the complex and tedious process for purifying GRS, and thereby has more practical applications in the food industry.","2016-08-18","2020-03-26 05:04:39","2020-03-26 05:04:39","2020-03-26 05:04:39","","","8","11","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27537844 PMCID: PMC4990194","","; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/3X2ZDRAM/Qin et al_2016_Functional Properties of Glutinous Rice Flour by Dry-Heat Treatment.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990194/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do this, we scanned a train of focused femtosecond laser pulses over the complex film in air, following which the non-irradiated complex was removed by rinsing the substrates with ethanol. A minimum line width of 6.1 &micro;m was obtained at a laser-pulse energy of 0.156 nJ and scanning speeds of 500 and 1000 &micro;m/s. This line width is significantly smaller than that obtained in previous work using a CO2 laser. In addition, the lines are electrically conducting. However, the minimum resistivity of the line pattern was 2.43 &times; 10&minus;6 &Omega;&middot;m, which is ~10 times greater than that of the pattern formed using the CO2 laser.

The Wilkinson design can also be used as a power combiner because it is made up of passive components and hence reciprocal. First published by Ernest J. Wilkinson in 1960, this circuit finds wide use in radio frequency communication systems utilizing multiple channels since the high degree of isolation between the output ports prevents crosstalk between the individual channels. It uses quarter wave transformers, which can be  easily fabricated as quarter wave lines on printed circuit boards. It is also possible to use other forms of transmission line (e.g. coaxial cable) or lumped circuit elements (inductors and capacitors).","2020-01-16","2020-04-05 00:05:22","2020-04-05 00:05:22","2020-04-05 00:05:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 936038077","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/XZ77IA8C/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microwave heating is recognized for its various advantages, such as: time and energy saving, very rapid heating rates, considerably reduced processing cycle time and temperature, fine microstructures and improved mechanical properties, better product performance, etc. Microwave material interaction for the materials having bound charge are well established but for highly conductive materials like metals there is not much information available to interpret the mechanism of microwave heating and subsequent sintering of metallic materials. The present study describes how the thermal profile of electrically conductive powder metal like copper changes with particle size and also with porosity content in other words initial green density when the material is exposed to 2.45 GHz microwave radiation in a multimode microwave furnace.","","2020-04-05 03:02:08","2020-04-05 03:02:08","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VNGLL93P/Mondal et al. - MICROWAVE HEATING OF PURE COPPER POWDER WITH DIFFE.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The device exhibits low turn-on voltage of 7 V, stable current density of 2 μA per tip, and high transconductance of 1.7 μS per 100 tips field emitter array at V/sub AC/=22 V. An in situ vacuum encapsulation employing recessed cavities by isotropic RIE (reactive ion etch) method and an electron beam evaporated molybdenum vacuum seal are implemented to fabricate the new field emitter triode. The superb field emitter characteristics are probably due to sub-micron dimension device structure and the pencil type lateral cathode tip employing upper and lower LOCOS oxidation.","1997-11","2020-04-05 21:41:22","2020-04-05 21:41:22","","538-540","","11","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Electron Device Letters","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/BPIA8UGC/641438.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This miniature pre-vacuum pump is realized as two-electrode siliconglass structure. Thanks to a very close inter-electrode distance it is possible to ignite a gas discharge even at 1000 hPa at voltage lower than 1000 V. The use of a silicon substrate as a getter material increases significantly pumping capacity. This pump is technologically compatible with earlier developed high vacuum micropump and after their integration they could cover a very wide pressure range from 1000 hPa down to 10−7 hPa.

However, by making devices from epitaxially grown III–V layers that are separated from a growth substrate, one can recycle the growth substrate to reduce costs. Here, we show damage-free removal of an epitaxial single-crystal GaAs film from its GaAs growth substrate using a laser that is absorbed by a smaller band gap, pseudomorphic indium gallium arsenide nitride layer grown between the substrate and the GaAs film. The liftoff process transfers the GaAs film to a flexible polymer substrate, and the transferred GaAs layer is indistinguishable in structural quality from its growth substrate.","2015-03","2020-04-06 15:11:36","2020-04-06 15:11:36","2020-04-06 15:11:36","1-5","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge Core","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/55L5W6LN/F7084882EE6B1FD4CEBB9CCC0F0CDCA4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All volunteers receiving the higher phage dose showed fecal phage 1 day after exposure; this prevalence was only 50% in subjects receiving the lower phage dose. No fecal phage was detectable a week after a 2-day course of oral phage application. Oral phage application did not cause a decrease in total fecal E. coli counts. In addition, no substantial phage T4 replication on the commensal E. coli population was observed. No adverse events related to phage application were reported. Serum transaminase levels remained in the normal range, and neither T4 phage nor T4-specific antibodies were observed in the serum of the subjects at the end of the study.

The dermal response reached maximum intensity 30 minutes after its onset and then faded completely within 60 minutes. The skin vasodilatation appeared in symmetrical patterns on the face, neck, shoulders, and back.

However, steam autoclaves typically used for this purpose may not be readily accessible to everyone in the scientific community, such as K-12 teachers, researchers in the field, students in under-funded laboratories, or persons in the developing world who lack funding and resources. This work examines the use of commercial electric pressure cookers as an alternative method for the sterilization of media, instruments, and waste. Four commonly available brands of pressure cooker were tested for their ability to sterilize microbiological media, a variety of metal instruments, and high-titer microbial cultures. All four pressure cookers were able to sterilize these starting materials as well as a range of microbial types, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, filamentous fungi, unicellular fungi, and mixed environmental samples. Only the Instant Pot, however, was able to sterilize autoclave tester ampoules of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores. These results suggest that, depending on the nature of the work undertaken, store-bought pressure cookers can be an appropriate substitute for commercial autoclaves. Their adoption may also help increase the accessibility of science to a broader range of investigators.","2018-12-11","2020-04-10 20:35:39","2020-04-10 20:35:39","2020-04-10 20:35:39","","","12","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 30533061 PMCID: PMC6289433","","; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/9FT2U4PK/Swenson et al_2018_Assessment and verification of commercially available pressure cookers for.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289433/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One important determinant for metabolism is the availability of oxygen allowing a more efficient metabolism. Especially in large scale bioreactors, the distribution of oxygen is inhomogeneous and individual cells encounter frequent changes. This might contribute to observed yield losses during process upscaling. Short-term gene expression data exist of an anaerobic E. coli batch culture shifting to aerobic conditions. The data reveal temporary upregulation of genes that are less efficient in terms of energy conservation than the genes predicted by conventional flux balance analyses. In this study, we provide evidence for a positive correlation between metabolic fluxes and gene expression. We then hypothesize that the more efficient enzymes are limited by their low expression, restricting flux through their reactions. We define a demand that triggers expression of the demanded enzymes that we explicitly include in our model. With these features we propose a method, demand-directed dynamic flux balance analysis, dddFBA, bringing together elements of several previously published methods. The introduction of additional flux constraints proportional to gene expression provoke a temporary demand for less efficient enzymes, which is in agreement with the transient upregulation of these genes observed in the data. In the proposed approach, the applied objective function of growth rate maximization together with the introduced constraints triggers expression of metabolically less efficient genes. This finding is one possible explanation for the yield losses observed in large scale bacterial cultivations where steady oxygen supply cannot be warranted.","2016-07-06","2020-04-11 03:25:51","2020-04-11 03:25:51","2020-04-11 03:25:51","","","7","11","","PLoS One","Transition of an Anaerobic Escherichia coli Culture to Aerobiosis","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27384956 PMCID: PMC4934858","","; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/CZKESCWB/von Wulffen et al_2016_Transition of an Anaerobic Escherichia coli Culture to Aerobiosis.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934858/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In nature, however, phages largely encounter non-growing cells. Bacteria entering stationary phase often activate well-studied stress defense mechanisms that drastically alter the cell, facilitating its long-term survival. An understanding of phage-host interactions in such conditions is of major importance from both an ecological and therapeutic standpoint. Here, we show that bacteriophage T4 can efficiently bind to, infect and kill E. coli in stationary phase, both in the presence and absence of a functional stationary-phase sigma factor, and explore the response of T4-infected stationary phase cells to the addition of fresh nutrients 5 or 24 hours after that infection. An unexpected new mode of response has been identified. “Hibernation” mode is a persistent but reversible dormant state in which the infected cells make at least some phage enzymes, but halt phage development until appropriate nutrients become available before producing phage particles. Our evidence indicates that the block in hibernation mode occurs after the middle-mode stage of phage development; host DNA breakdown and the incorporation of the released nucleotides into phage DNA indicate that the enzymes of the nucleotide synthesizing complex, under middle-mode control, have been made and assembled into a functional state. Once fresh glucose and amino acids become available, the standard lytic infection process rapidly resumes and concentrations of up to 1011 progeny phage (an average of about 40 phage per initially-present cell) are produced. All evidence is consistent with the hibernation-mode control point lying between middle mode and late mode T4 gene expression. We have also observed a “scavenger” response, where the infecting phage takes advantage of whatever few nutrients are available to produce small quantities of progeny within 2 to 5 hours after infection. The scavenger response seems able to produce no more than an average of one phage per originally-available cell, and few if any further progeny are produced by cells in this mode even if fresh nutrients are made available later.","2016","2020-04-14 14:07:42","2020-04-14 14:07:45","2020-04-14 14:07:42","","","","7","","Front.

Human epidemiological studies gave evidence of increased risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma. RF radiation was classified as Group 2B, a possible human carcinogen. Further epidemiological, animal and mechanistic studies have strengthened the association. In spite of this, in most countries little or nothing has been done to reduce exposure and educate people on health hazards from RF radiation. On the contrary ambient levels have increased. In 2014 the WHO launched a draft of a Monograph on RF fields and health for public comments. It turned out that five of the six members of the Core Group in charge of the draft are affiliated with International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an industry loyal NGO, and thus have a serious conflict of interest. Just as by ICNIRP, evaluation of non-thermal biological effects from RF radiation are dismissed as scientific evidence of adverse health effects in the Monograph. This has provoked many comments sent to the WHO. However, at a meeting on March 3, 2017 at the WHO Geneva office it was stated that the WHO has no intention to change the Core Group.","2017-06-21","2020-04-15 03:34:21","2020-04-15 03:34:21","2020-04-15 03:34:21","405-413","","2","51","","Int J Oncol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 28656257 PMCID: PMC5504984","<p>A useful dissenting opinion.</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/SFNPWQGV/Hardell_2017_World Health Organization, radiofrequency radiation and health - a hard nut to.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504984/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Just as anyone can learn to write, or get better at writing, anyone can learn to code or get better at coding.

Supplement","","0306-9443","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2149302/","Some of the physical aspects of delivering microwave energy to tissues have been discussed. Effective penetration of a few cm may be achieved with external applicators whilst small coaxial or cylindrical devices can induce localized heating in sites accessible to catheters or to direct invasion. To heat deep tissue sites in general, systems of greater complexity involving a number of applicators with particular phase relationships between them are required. The problems of thermometry in the presence of electromagnetic fields fall outside the scope of this article. Their solution, however, is no less important to the future of clinical hyperthermia than the development of heating techniques. Finally, it should be remembered that physiological parameters such as blood flow have appreciable effects in determining the efficacy of the physical techniques described above.","1982-03","2020-04-21 03:17:33","2020-04-21 03:17:34","2020-04-21 03:17:33","9-15","","","5","","Br J Cancer Suppl","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 6950781 PMCID: PMC2149302","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ZI9LWZMA/Hand_1982_Physical techniques for delivering microwave energy to tissues.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2149302/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The natural frequencies of such resonances will, generally, be in the microwave frequency range. Some of these systems will be coupled to the electromagnetic field by the charge distributions they carry, thus admitting the possibility that microwave exposures may generate physiological effects in man and other species. However, such microwave excitable resonances are expected to be strongly damped by interaction with their aqueous biological environment. Although those dissipation mechanisms have been studied, the limitations on energy transfers that follow from the limited coupling of these resonances to the electromagnetic field have not generally been considered. We show that this coupling must generally be very small and thus the absorbed energy is so strongly limited that such resonances cannot affect biology significantly even if the systems are much less strongly damped than expected from basic dissipation models.","2002-03-01","2020-04-22 15:35:31","2020-05-10 22:29:34","2020-04-22 15:35:31","1147-1152","","3","82","","Biophysical Journal","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/2HPCS2V3/Adair_2002_Vibrational Resonances in Biological Systems at Microwave Frequencies.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RUPBD6ZN/S0006349502754738.html","","Barfuss_Book_Club","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For Brownian Dynamics the friction has to be so strong that the particles' velocities are damped much faster than the duration of an integration timestep. Here we show that this conceptual limit can be dropped with an analytic integration of the equations of damped motion. In the resulting Langevin integration scheme our recently proposed approximate form of the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles can be incorparated conveniently, leading to a fast multi-particle propagation scheme, which captures more of the short-time and short-range solvent effects than standard BD. Comparing the dynamics of a bead-spring model of a short peptide, we recommend to run simulations of small biological molecules with the Langevin type finite damping and to include the hydrodynamic interactions.","2009","2020-04-22 17:07:29","2020-04-22 17:07:29","2020-04-22 17:07:29","104102","","10","131","","J.

This discussion has been recently activated by the increasing human exposure to RF fields from wireless communication systems. Modulation is used in all wireless communication systems to enable the signal to carry information. A previous review in 1998 indicated that experimental evidence for modulation-specific effects of RF energy is weak. This article reviews recent studies (published after 1998) on the biological effects of modulated RF fields. The focus is on studies that have compared the effects of modulated and unmodulated (continuous wave) RF fields, or compared the effects of different kinds of modulations; studies that used only one type of signal are not included. While the majority of recent studies have reported no modulation-specific effects, there are a few interesting exceptions indicating that there may be specific effects from amplitude-modulated RF fields on the human central nervous system. These findings warrant follow-up studies.

We used the alkaline comet assay, which is a highly sensitive method to assess DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile lesions.

The temperature rise in the blood samples at steady state was 3.5 ± 0.1 ◦C.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans. A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.

Each phage contains one double-stranded DNA molecule encapsulated in an icosahedral head, which is about 50 nm (0.05 μ) in diameter; a flexible tubular tail, which is about 150 nm (0.15 μ) long and terminates in a fiber, projects from the head (Kellenberger and Edgar, 1971). Lambda is an obligatory parasite of Escherichia coli. Growth begins when a phage particle attaches to the host by the tip of its tail and injects its DNA molecule. Lambda is a temperate phage and, thus, can multiply in E. coli by one of three ways: (1) In productive growth, the injected DNA molecule directs the synthesis of numerous gene products; these promote replication of the phage DNA, synthesis of the phage heads and tails, packaging of the DNA into mature phage particles, and eventual lysis of the cell. At 37°C it takes about 40 minutes for a lytic cycle, and about 100 infective progeny phage are produced. (2) Lambda DNA can also persist in the host cell as a prophage and replicate passively as an integral part of the bacterial genome. In this case the injected DNA must first direct the synthesis of the gene products that promote its linear insertion into the genome of the host. Next, it turns on the synthesis of the repressor, which blocks transcription of those genes responsible for autonomous lambda DNA replication and most other phage functions.","1974","2020-04-25 16:16:57","2020-04-25 16:16:57","2020-04-25 16:16:57","309-322","","","","","","","","","","","Springer US","Boston, MA","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4899-1710-2_19","","","","","","King, Robert C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS‐CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS‐CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS‐CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS. SARS‐CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle. These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS‐CoV may also be targets of SARS‐CoV infection. The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS‐CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS‐CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.

To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. The morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the S protein of SARSCoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated. This state revealed by cryo-EM first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.","2020-03-05","2020-04-25 17:04:45","2020-04-25 17:04:52","2020-04-25 17:04:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.02.972927","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/Y92IR4YB/Liu et al. - 2020 - Viral Architecture of SARS-CoV-2 with Post-Fusion .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

En su forma más simple están constituidos por una cadena de material genético protegida por una cubierta de proteínas llamada cápside, cuya formación y propiedades juegan un papel crucial en el ciclo vital de los virus. Un mayor conocimiento de la física que se esconde tras los virus permitiría no sólo combatirlos, sino también usarlos para aplicaciones útiles en disciplinas como la medicina, nanociencia o farmacia. En esta tesis nos hemos centrado en la caracterización física de las propiedades mecánicas y el autoensamblaje de la cápsida de virus esféricos con simetría icosaédrica. Para ello hemos propuesto un modelo de grano-grueso basado en un potencial de interacción sencillo entre las subunidades estructurales de la cápsida. Los parámetros del modelo están directamente relacionados con propiedades físicamente relevantes y que pueden ser medibles experimentalmente, como son la curvatura espontánea de la cápside y la constante elástica de flexión. Estos dos ingredientes son cruciales para determinar la arquitectura y el tamaño de los virus. Con este nuevo modelo, hemos hecho simulaciones usando diferentes técnicas para reproducir y estudiar experimentos de auto-ensamblaje. En particular, hemos analizado el rango de parámetros y las condiciones adecuadas que determinan la forma y la estabilidad de las distintas estructuras de los virus. También hemos analizado la cinética de autoensamblaje y los pasos intermedios de la formación de virus, inaccesibles experimentalmente por las características del proceso. Además hemos determinado la importancia de la geometría y más concretamente del número de triangulación y la clase en la respuesta mecánica y en la tendencia a cambiar de forma durante el proceso de maduración. Este cambio de forma conlleva una mayor rigidez y tolerancia a la presión, que puede aportar ventajas biológicas especialmente en virus de ADN de doble cadena. Finalmente, hemos desarrollado modelos de elementos finitos y simulaciones discretas para interpretar experimentos de nanoindentación con AFM. Con ellos hemos estudiado la ruptura y la dureza de la cápside del bacteriófago T7 orientada según los diferentes ejes de simetría icosaédrica, y desarrollado un método para determinar la presión interna en el bacteriófago phi29.","2013-10-31","2020-04-25 17:41:40","2020-04-25 17:41:45","2020-04-25 17:41:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","(c) Aznar, 2013","","","","diposit.ub.edu","","Accepted: 2014-01-30T10:56:32Z Publisher: Universitat de Barcelona","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/G5DRFNTD/Aznar Palenzuela_2013_Coarse-Grained Modeling of the Assembly and Mechanical Properties of Viruses.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VMS4WMKL/49279.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These effects are found to be extremely important and substantial, introducing qualitative changes in the charge state of the capsid such as a transition from net-positive to net-negative charge depending on the solution pH. The overall charge of the virus capsid arises as a consequence of a complicated balance with the chemical dissociation equilibrium of the amino acids and the electrostatic interaction between them, and the translational entropy of the mobile solution ions, i.e., counterion release. We show that to properly describe and predict the charging equilibrium of viral capsids in general, one needs to include molecular details as exemplified by the acid-base equilibrium of the detailed distribution of amino acids in the proteinaceous capsid shell.","2014-10-21","2020-04-26 01:52:26","2020-05-06 00:38:09","2020-04-26 01:52:26","1970-1979","","8","107","","Biophys J","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25418178 PMCID: PMC4213675","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/HGL6YX72/Nap et al_2014_The Role of Solution Conditions in the Bacteriophage PP7 Capsid Charge.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/7RJRCDV7/Nap et al_2014_The Role of Solution Conditions in the Bacteriophage PP7 Capsid Charge.pdf; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213675/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213675/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show surface-induced correlations, excluded volume, and electrostatic forces are sufficient to predict most of the major features of the current structural data for DNA packaged within viral capsids without additional ordering due to elastic bending forces for the polymer. Current models assume highly-ordered, even spooled, hexagonally packed conformations based on interpretation of cryo-EM density maps. We show herein that the surface induced packing of short (6mer), unconnected DNA polymer segments is the only necessary ingredient in creating ringed densities consistent with experimental density maps. This implies the ensemble of possible conformations of polymeric DNA within the capsid that are consistent with cryo-EM data may be much larger than implied by traditional interpretations where such rings can only result from highly-ordered spool-like conformations. This opens the possibility of a more disordered, entropically-driven view of phage packaging thermodynamics. We also show the electrostatics of the DNA contributes a large portion of the internal hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of a phage virion, suggesting that nonlinear elastic anomalies might reduce the overall elastic bending enthalpy of more disordered conformations to have allowable free energies.","2013-02-21","2020-03-25 23:51:08","2020-07-16 06:56:24","2020-04-26 02:16:33","","","7","138","","J Chem Phys","Communication","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","tex.ids: myersCommunicationOriginContributions2013 PMCID: PMC3592880 PMID: 23444988","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/HH8ME524/Myers_Pettitt_2013_Communication.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/M8JRWLDF/Myers_Pettitt_2013_Communication.pdf; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3592880/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3592880/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ejection force arises from the energy stored in the capsid as a consequence of the viral genome (double-stranded DNA) being strongly bent and crowded on itself. The resisting force is associated with the osmotic pressure exerted by the colloidal particles in the host solution. Indeed, recent experimental work has demonstrated that the extent of ejection can be progressively limited by increasing the external osmotic pressure; at a sufficiently high pressure the ejection is completely suppressed. We outline here a theoritical analysis that allows a determination of the internal (capsid) pressure by examining the different relations between force and pressure inside and outside the capsid, using the experimentally measured position of the force balance.","2004-03-09","2020-04-26 02:28:44","2020-04-26 02:28:53","2020-04-26 02:28:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: physics/0403057","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in J.

Cryo-EM can be used to identify charge and chemical identity., Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) directly images the distribution of electrostatic potential (ESP) within macromolecules, and thus can provide much more information about atomic charge than X-ray crystallography. The electron-scattering length of an isolated ion is quite different from that of the corresponding neutral atom. The difference is very large at small scattering angles where the effects of electron distributions are largest, but becomes smaller at high scattering angles where nuclear charge determines outcomes. For this reason, in cryo-EM maps that have been solved at resolutions lower than ∼2.5 Å, peaks corresponding to anions will always be less prominent than those of cations, and may even be negative. Furthermore, if a map of this kind is smeared computationally after the fact, which reduces its effective resolution, anion peaks will diminish in size, cation peaks will grow and peaks that represent uncharged atoms will remain about the same. These effects can be used to determine the sign of the charges carried by the ions associated with a macromolecule and even estimate their magnitudes. The ESP value for a cation in a cation–anion pair is smaller than the value of the cation in isolation, but the ESP value for the anion in the ionic pair is greater than the value of the anion in isolation. The experimental range of ESP values for Mg2+ relative to that of the closest C1′ atom is found to be between 0.57 and 1.27.","2018-06-01","2020-04-26 04:22:13","2020-05-06 00:37:59","2020-04-26 04:22:13","375-381","","Pt 4","5","","IUCrJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 30002838 PMCID: PMC6038950","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/GK7NRIZD/Wang et al. - 2018 - Identification of ions in experimental electrostat.pdf; ; ; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RQ9LFC3D/Wang et al_2018_Identification of ions in experimental electrostatic potential maps.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6038950/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6038950/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have examined the proteins of a large number of representative eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses for the occurrence of significant clusters, runs, and periodic patterns of charge. Clusters and runs of positive charge are prominent in many capsid and core proteins, whereas surface (glyco)proteins frequently contain a negative charge cluster. Significant charge configurations are abundant in regulatory proteins implicated in transcriptional transactivation and cellular transformation. Proteins with charge structures are much more predominant in animal DNA viruses as compared to animal RNA viruses and prokaryotic viruses. This contrast might reflect the role of protein charge structures in facilitating competitive virus-host interactions involving the cellular transcription, translation, protein sorting, and transport apparatus.","1988-12-01","2020-05-01 22:01:01","2020-05-01 22:02:40","2020-05-01 22:01:01","9396-9400","","24","85","","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/9HFZ42ZC/9396.full.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report the results of molecular dynamics simulations and analyze the connection between the number of ions inside an empty capsid of PCV2 virus and its stability. We compare the crystallographic structures of the capsids with unresolved N‐termini and without them in realistic conditions (room temperature and aqueous solution) and show that the structure is preserved. We find that the chloride ions play a key role in the stability of the capsid. A low number of chloride ions results in loss of the native icosahedral symmetry, while an optimal number of chloride ions create a neutralizing layer next to the positively charged inner surface of the capsid. Understanding the dependence of the capsid stability on the distribution of the ions will help clarify the details of the viral life cycle that is ultimately connected to the role of packaged viral genome inside the capsid.","","2020-05-01 23:51:22","2020-05-01 23:51:53","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/XEKSL63K/All_atom_molecular_dynamics_simulations_of_entire_virus_capsid.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The continuous emergence of new influenza virus strains due to mutation and re-assortment complicates the control of the virus and necessitates the permanent development of novel drugs and vaccines. The laboratory-based study of influenza requires a reliable and cost-effective method for the propagation of the virus. Here, a comprehensive protocol is provided for influenza A virus propagation in fertile chicken eggs, which consistently yields high titer viral stocks. In brief, serum pathogen-free (SPF) fertilized chicken eggs are incubated at 37 °C and 55-60% humidity for 10-11 days. Over this period, embryo development can be easily monitored using an egg candler. Virus inoculation is carried out by injection of virus stock into the allantoic cavity using a needle. After 2 days of incubation at 37 °C, the eggs are chilled for at least 4 hr at 4 °C. The eggshell above the air sac and the chorioallantoic membrane are then carefully opened, and the allantoic fluid containing the virus is harvested. The fluid is cleared from debris by centrifugation, aliquoted and transferred to -80 °C for long-term storage. The large amount (5-10 ml of virus-containing fluid per egg) and high virus titer which is usually achieved with this protocol has made the usage of eggs for virus preparation our favorable method, in particular for in vitro studies which require large quantities of virus in which high dosages of the same virus stock are needed.","2015-03-19","2020-05-01 23:59:51","2020-05-06 00:37:54","","","","97","","","J Vis Exp","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25867050 PMCID: PMC4401370","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/N6VFADAM/Brauer and Chen - 2015 - Influenza virus propagation in embryonated chicken.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/JAQTC4YA/Brauer and Chen - 2015 - Influenza virus propagation in embryonated chicken.pdf; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25867050; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25867050","","Animals; Chick Embryo; Chickens; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Virus Replication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measurements made with nanowire arrays modified with antibodies for influenza A showed discrete conductance changes characteristic of binding and unbinding in the presence of influenza A but not paramyxovirus or adenovirus. Simultaneous electrical and optical measurements using fluorescently labeled influenza A were used to demonstrate conclusively that the conductance changes correspond to binding/unbinding of single viruses at the surface of nanowire devices. pH-dependent studies further show that the detection mechanism is caused by a field effect, and that the nanowire devices can be used to determine rapidly isoelectric points and variations in receptor-virus binding kinetics for different conditions. Lastly, studies of nanowire devices modified with antibodies specific for either influenza or adenovirus show that multiple viruses can be selectively detected in parallel. The possibility of large-scale integration of these nanowire devices suggests potential for simultaneous detection of a large number of distinct viral threats at the single virus level.","2004-09-28","2020-05-02 01:02:15","2020-05-02 01:02:15","2020-05-02 01:02:15","14017-14022","","39","101","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2004, The National Academy of Sciences.

Serwer, Electrophoresis 1983, 3, 375–382) have been used for the first time to detect and characterize plant viruses. PMV and some SAD strains produce two particles that copurify during rate zonal sedimentation, but form separate bands during agarose gel electrophoresis (forms 1 and 2). By measuring electrophoretic mobility (μ) as a function of agarose percentage and correcting for electroosmosis, it was found that: (a) form 1 has a solid support-free μ (μ0) different from the μ0 of form 2, and (b) forms 1 and 2 have the same radius (14.6 ± 0.6nm). Form 1 is indistinguishable from form 2 by either electron microscopy or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The μ0 of form 1 and the relative amount of forms 1 and 2 vary with the virus strain and can be used to help identify strains. A previously described satellite of PMV and some SAD strains also has two forms. The radius of the satellite of one SAD strain was found to be 7.6 ± 0.3 nm. A procedure of differential gel staining was developed for distinguishing the 14.6 nm virus from its 7.6 nm satellite. After agarose gel electrophoresis of either totally unfractionated or partially fractionated, infected grass extracts, virus particles wer detected without interference from host components. The procedures used here should be useful for rapid disease diagnosis and strain typing of the above and possibly other plant viruses.","1984","2020-05-02 14:32:50","2020-05-02 14:32:50","2020-05-02 14:32:50","202-208","","4","5","","","Rapid detection and characterization of plant virused by agarose gel electrophoresis","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 1984 Verlag Chemie, GmbH","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/elps.1150050404","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/XBRW5TE3/elps.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of varactor diodes as tuning elements allows continuous and independent control of these parameters.

The passband-width tunability is achieved by placing variable coupling reducers between the ﬁlter resonators. The coupling reducers, operating as bandwidth control subnetworks, are designed as detuned resonators made up of a line segment ending in a variable capacitor. The proposed ﬁlter structure is experimentally validated with the design, construction in suspended stripline technology, and characterization of a low-cost ﬁlter prototype for terrestrial digital video broadcasting receivers operating in the UHF band (470–862 MHz). Other relevant factors, such as the intermodulation distortion produced by the varactors used to control the bandwidth electronically or the power-handling performance of the constructed ﬁlter, are also discussed.

Laboratory Radio Frequency (RF) measurements of the instrument bandpass often require complex test setups and are subject to a number of systematic effects driven by thermal issues and impedance matching, particularly if cryogenic operation is involved. In this paper we present an approach to modeling radiometers bandpasses by integrating simulations and RF measurements of individual components. This method is based on QUCS (Quasi Universal Circuit Simulator), an open-source circuit simulator, which gives the flexibility of choosing among the available devices, implementing new analytical software models or using measured S-parameters. Therefore an independent estimate of the instrument bandpass is achieved using standard individual component measurements and validated analytical simulations. In order to automate the process of preparing input data, running simulations and exporting results we developed the Python package python-qucs and released it under GNU Public License. We discuss, as working cases, bandpass response modeling of the COFE and Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) radiometers and compare results obtained with QUCS and with a commercial circuit simulator software. The main purpose of bandpass modeling in COFE is to optimize component matching, while in LFI they represent the best estimation of frequency response, since end-to-end measurements were strongly affected by systematic effects.","2010-12-20","2020-05-07 21:05:21","2020-05-07 21:05:21","2020-05-07 21:05:21","T12001-T12001","","12","5","","J.

The isoelectric point, the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and X-ray protein crystallography. The database, available at http://isoelectricpointdb.org allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customised fractions of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover, Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life. For instance, using Proteome-pI data, it is clear that Eukaryotes, which evolved tight control of homeostasis, encode proteins with pI values near the cell pH. In contrast, Archaea living frequently in extreme environments can possess proteins with a wide range of isoelectric points. The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. Apart from data for individual proteomes, datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated and made available in CSV format.","2017-01-04","2020-05-08 19:21:01","2020-07-16 06:56:49","2020-05-08 19:21:01","D1112-D1116","","Database issue","45","","Nucleic Acids Res","Proteome-pI","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","tex.ids: kozlowskiProteomepIProteomeIsoelectric2017a PMCID: PMC5210655 PMID: 27789699","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/K97KGBZ3/Kozlowski_2017_Proteome-pI.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/NFJRD52U/Kozlowski_2017_Proteome-pI.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210655/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This electrostatic charge determines the mobility of the soft particle in an electric field and thus governs its colloidal behaviour which plays a major role in virus sorption processes. The pH value at which the net surface charge switches its sign is referred to as the isoelectric point (abbreviations: pI or IEP) and is a characteristic parameter of the virion in equilibrium with its environmental water chemistry. Here, we review the IEP measurements of viruses that replicate in hosts of kingdom plantae, bacteria and animalia. IEPs of viruses are found in pH range from 1.9 to 8.4; most frequently, they are measured in a band of 3.5 < IEP < 7. However, the data appear to be scattered widely within single virus species. This discrepancy is discussed and should be considered when IEP values are used to account for virus sorption processes.","2010-08","2020-05-08 19:28:10","2020-05-08 19:28:10","","388-397","","2","109","","J.

Theoretical and clinical models of bronchial morphometry have so far focused on bronchial lumen diameter, and bronchial length and angles, mainly assessed from bronchial casts. However, these models do not provide information on bronchial wall thickness. This paper reports in vivo values of cross-sectional wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter in ten healthy subjects as assessed by multi-detector computed tomography. A validated dedicated software package was used to measure these morphometric parameters up to the 14th bronchial generation, with respect to Weibel's model of bronchial morphometry, and up to the 12th according to Boyden's classification. Measured lumen diameters and homothety ratios were compared with theoretical values obtained from previously published studies, and no difference was found when considering dichotomic division of the bronchial tree. Mean wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter were then provided according to bronchial generation order, and mean homothety ratios were computed for wall area, lumen area and wall thickness as well as equations giving the mean value of each parameter for a given bronchial generation with respect to its value in generation 0 (trachea). Multi-detector computed tomography measurements of bronchial morphometric parameters may help to improve our knowledge of bronchial anatomy in vivo, our understanding of the pathophysiology of bronchial diseases and the evaluation of pharmacological effects on the bronchial wall.","2007-11","2020-05-09 00:52:29","2020-05-09 00:52:29","2020-05-09 00:52:29","579-588","","5","211","","J Anat","Assessment of bronchial wall thickness and lumen diameter in human adults using multi-detector computed tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 17919291 PMCID: PMC2375785","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/MGW2Y44H/Montaudon et al_2007_Assessment of bronchial wall thickness and lumen diameter in human adults using.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2375785/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to measure the thickness of cadaveric human lung tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2012 and February 2013, whole lungs were procured from 12 donors. Inclusion criteria included negative serology, no prior thoracic surgery, and completion of measurements within 72 hours of death. Tissue thickness was measured in the anterior-to-posterior direction using a tissue measuring device (TMD) at 41 lung locations. The tissue measuring device applied a constant pressure (8 g/mm2) via a plunger for 15 seconds before reading the thickness. RESULTS: Cadaveric lung tissue thickness displayed a large variation by location and within each location. Mean thickness in the anterior-to-posterior direction ranged from 1.5 mm (right middle lobe [inferior peripheral] location) to 9.0 mm (right inferior lobe [mid-central] location). In general, the periphery of the lung lobes was thinner than the central locations (e.g., mean peripheral location thickness: 4.1 mm; mean central location thickness: 5.9 mm). The thinnest tissues among the 12 donor cadaveric lung specimens were found in the one donor with a history of severe emphysema/chronic bronchitis. Height (P = 0.012) and weight (P = 0.036) were positively correlated with tissue thickness. Additionally, after adjusting for height, cadaveric lung tissue was 3.0 mm thicker for females than males. CONCLUSIONS: Large variations of lung tissue thickness were demonstrated throughout the lung as well as within each measured location across different cadaveric specimens. Generally, peripheral locations were thinner than the central locations of the lobes. There was a strong positive correlation between thickness and height, and females had slightly thicker lung tissue than males of the same height.","2016-10-26","2020-05-09 01:03:04","2020-05-10 21:41:45","","207-213","","","29","","Surg Technol Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27466868","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27466868","grade_a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This procedure is commonly done using a 4.5cm catheter, and the optimal site for chest wall puncture is controversial. We hypothesize that needle thoracostomy cannot be performed using this catheter length irrespective of the site chosen in either gender. Methods A retrospective review of all chest computed tomography (CT) scans obtained on trauma patients from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 was performed. Patients aged 18 and 80 years were included and patients whose chest wall thickness exceeded the boundary of the images acquired were excluded. Chest wall thickness was measured at the 2nd intercostal (ICS), midclavicular line (MCL) and the 5th ICS, anterior axillary line (AAL). Injury severity score (ISS), chest wall thickness, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed. Results 201 patients were included, 54% male. Average (SD) BMI was 26 (7)kg/m2. The average chest wall thickness in the overall cohort was 4.08 (1.4)cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 4.55 (1.7)cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. 29% of the overall cohort (27 male and 32 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 45% (54 male and 36 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. There was no significant interaction between gender and chest wall thickness at either site. BMI was positively associated with chest wall thickness at both the 2nd and 5th ICS/AAL. Conclusion A 4.5cm catheter is inadequate for needle thoracostomy in most patients regardless of puncture site or gender.","2013-09-01","2020-05-09 01:07:01","2020-05-09 01:07:01","2020-05-09 01:07:01","1183-1185","","9","44","","Injury","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The filter consists of a microstrip line coupled to a coplanar waveguide (CPW) that was fabricated on the ground of the microstrip line. The proposed filter has been simulated, fabricated and measured for UWB system. The measured results demonstrated the UWB properties from 3.0GHz to 10.63GHz (-10 dB bandwidth) and the potential to be wider. An three-section filter shown insertion loss at central frequency is about 0.32dB and very flat over the whole band. The group delay, which is important to an impulse radio UWB system, is about 0.42 ns over the most central band, and less than 0.95 ns over the whole band. The filter also exhibited a good performance outside the band, both at low frequency end (to meet FCC limit) and high frequency end higher than 18GHz with insertion loss larger than 30 dB.","","2020-05-12 02:36:57","2020-05-12 02:36:57","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/5LV2HS9T/Li et al. - An Ultra-Wideband Bandpass Filter Using Broadside-.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MUUDPTY7","book","2001","Weber, Robert J.","Introduction to microwave circuits: radio frequency and design applications","","978-0-7803-4704-5","","","","""Do you want to design a wireless transmitter or receiver for hand-held telephones? Have you wondered why the printed circuit wires on high-frequency circuits don't always run in a straight line? This valuable text will answer all of your questions regarding component parasitics and circuit characterization for rf/microwave amplifier, oscillator, and filter circuit design and analysis. You will understand why capacitors act as inductors and vice versa and why amplifiers work like oscillators, while oscillators for local area networks work more like local area heaters. Application of the information in Introduction to Microwave Circuits will reduce design-cycle time and costs, markedly increasing the probability of first-time success in printed circuit or monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) design. Several approaches are taken into consideration, such as the effects of currents on the ground plane, bypass and coupling capacitors, and nonlinear effects in linear circuits. Featured topics include: * Incorporation of component parasitics in the design cycle * Closed form solution to oscillator design * Odd mode stability analysis * PIN diode analysis for high-power switching applications An integrated design example of a 1.25 GHz amplifier, oscillator, and filter printed circuit is also included, which could be useful in printed circuit board designs from tens of megahertz to tens of gigahertz. Introduction to Microwave Circuits provides the tools necessary to analyze or synthesize microwave circuits. This text is an essential reference for undergraduate students, microwave engineers, and administrators. Also, it will assist experienced designers in other fields to meet the current rapid expansion of communication system applications and work effectively in microwave circuit design. About the Author Robert J. Weber began his prolific career in the Solid State Research Laboratory at the Collins Radio Company, later a part of Rockwell International. For 25 years, he worked on advanced development and applied research in the one- to ten-gigahertz frequency range and received several distinguished awards for his valuable contributions to the field. Dr. Weber is involved in ongoing experimental research in integrating microwave circuits with other devices such as MEMS, chemical sensors, and electro-optics. Also, he teaches microwave circuit design and fiber-optics communications at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University. Dr. Weber is an IEEE Fellow.""

For the purpose of obtaining insulation materials with desirable dielectric and electrical resistance properties, we investigated several fillers with nonlinear electrical properties doped in silicon rubber composites, and their dependency on the temperature and field. The samples of silicone rubber composites with different components were prepared using barium strontium titanate (BST) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as the filler, and high temperature vulcanized silicone rubber (SiR) as the matrix. The investigations revealed that the BST-doped samples showed different dielectric properties compared to ZnO-doped composites, with an increase in the electric field, which was nonlinear. The resistivity of both doped samples was similar. Results demonstrated that it was possible to achieve higher values of permittivity, and lower values of tanδ and resistivity, with respect to unfilled silicone rubber composites over a wide electrical field and temperature range. Discussion of the results attributes these important functional behaviours to the spontaneous polarization of nonlinear nanoparticles and the interaction between the SiR chains and the nonlinear nanoparticles at the interfacial area.","2018-11-30","2020-05-18 16:26:48","2020-05-18 16:26:48","2020-05-18 16:26:48","","","12","23","","Molecules","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 30513654 PMCID: PMC6320950","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VKVU9AI2/Guo et al_2018_Nonlinear Electrical Properties and Field Dependency of BST and Nano-ZnO-Doped.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6320950/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite its many advantages, the platform has a size limitation due to the centripetal pumping mechanism in which fluids can only be moved from the center of the disc to the rim. This limits the footprint of the microfluidic network to one radius of the disc, and this in turn limits the amount of space available to embed complex assays. In order to overcome this space limitation problem, we are developing new techniques to pump fluids back toward the center of the disc as to allow greater path lengths for the fluidic network. This study presents a novel pumping mechanism for centrifugal microfluidics utilizing a combination of centrifugation and pneumatic compression. Pneumatic energy is stored during high-speed centrifugation with sample fluids trapping then compressing air in specially designed chambers. The accumulated pneumatic energy is released by spinning down, which expands the trapped air and thus pumps liquids back toward the center of the CD. This newly developed method overcomes current limitations of centripetal pumping avoiding external manipulation or surface treatments. In this article, we explore the design of appropriate chambers to induce pneumatic pumping and analytically describe the mechanics behind the pumping action. For proof of principle, we have applied pneumatic pumping to siphon priming.","2010-08-01","2020-05-20 01:01:20","2020-05-20 01:01:20","2020-05-20 01:01:20","541-549","","2","9","","Microfluid Nanofluid","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p>Very neat strobe-light image capture</p> <p>Also, they use a vinyl cutter to make the microchannel pattern,</p> <p>rather than machining the pattern into the polycarbonate.</p> <p>Resivoirs are machined.</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/XV3HSFEH/Gorkin et al_2010_Pneumatic pumping in centrifugal microfluidic platforms.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The antenna design and experimental results are presented.","2006","2020-05-20 02:46:19","2020-05-20 02:46:19","2020-05-20 02:46:19","379-382","","3","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.4218/etrij.06.0205.0132","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ZEZDLTJB/Chung et al_2006_Reconfigurable Microstrip Patch Antenna with Switchable Polarization.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/L28RG8T9/etrij.06.0205.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was the case in six of the twelve serendipitous discoveries reviewed in this paper, ie, aniline purple, penicillin, lysergic acid diethylamide, meprobamate, chlorpromazine, and imipramine, in the case of three drugs, ie, potassium bromide, chloral hydrate, and lithium, the discovery was serendipitous because an utterly false rationale led to correct empirical results; and in case of two others, ie, iproniazid and sildenafil, because valuable indications were found for these drugs which were not initially those sought.

A flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled microwave ablation (MWA) catheter was developed to evaluate the feasibility and safety both in ex vivo and in vivo porcine models. Methods Using direct penetration of the catheter through the surface of ex vivo porcine lung, ablations (n=9) were performed at 70, 80, 90 W for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the catheter and 10, 15, 20 mm away from the tip were measured. Under bronchoscopy conditions in porcine lung, ablations (n=18, 6 in ex vivo and 12 in vivo) were performed at 80 W for 5 minutes. Computed tomography (CT) was acquired perioperative, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post ablation. Ablation zones were excised at 24 hours and 4 weeks respectively. Long-axis diameter (Dl) and short-axis diameter (Ds) were measured and tissues were sectioned for pathological examination. Results In-ex vivo lung, the temperature at 20 mm removed was over 60 °C at 80 W for 288±26 seconds. The ablations under bronchoscopic conditions were successful in-ex vivo and in vivo lung. No complications occurred during the procedures. Coagulation necrosis was visible at 24 hours, and repaired fibrous tissue was seen at 4 weeks. Conclusions The flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled MWA is feasible and safe. This early animal data holds promise of MWA becoming a potential therapeutic tool for Peripheral Lung Cancers.","2019-12","2020-05-21 00:06:27","2020-05-21 00:06:31","2020-05-21 00:06:27","787-796","","6","8","","Transl Lung Cancer Res","Flexible bronchoscopy-guided microwave ablation in peripheral porcine lung","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 32010557 PMCID: PMC6976383","","; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/A24392FF/Yuan et al_2019_Flexible bronchoscopy-guided microwave ablation in peripheral porcine lung.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976383/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The smart platform is developed to extend conventional Lab-on-a-Disc applications with an electronic interface, providing additional flow control and sensing capabilities to centrifugal microfluidics platforms. Wireless power is transferred from a Qi-compliant transmitter to the eLoaD platform during rotation. An Arduino-based microcontroller, a Bluetooth communication module, and an on-board SD-card are integrated into the platform. This generalises the applicability of the eLoaD and its modules for performing a wide range of laboratory unit operations, procedures, or diagnostic assays, all controlled wirelessly during spinning. The lightweight platform is fully reusable and modular in design and construction. An interchangeable and non-disposable application disc is fitted with the necessary sensors and/or actuators for a specific assay or experiment to be performed. A particular advantage is the ability to continuously monitor and interact with LoaD experiments, overcoming the limitations of stroboscopy. We demonstrate the applicability of the platform for three sensing experiments involving optical, electrochemical, and temperature detection, and one actuation experiment involving controlled heating/cooling. The complete electronic designs and example programming codes are extensively documented in the supplementary material for easy adaptation.","2018-10-15","2020-05-21 00:19:24","2020-05-21 00:19:24","2020-05-21 00:19:24","464-473","","","117","","Biosensors and Bioelectronics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/BE9LT3JF/S095656631830410X.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/9UHLYS7E/Torres Delgado et al_2018_The eLoaD platform endows centrifugal microfluidics with on-disc power and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key device in the system is the two-port phase modulator, which functions, in conjunction with a dispersive element in the loop, to form a high-Q microwave filter to perform microwave frequency selection. The central frequency of the microwave filter is a function of the optical wavelength and the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive element, therefore, the oscil-lation frequency can be simply tuned by tuning the wavelength of the laser source or the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive ele-ment. A theoretical analysis is provided, which is verified by exper-iments. The phase noise performance and the frequency tunability are both experimentally investigated.

We investigated whether pathogens present in mucus acquire resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants, and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Both the resistance of influenza A virus and Escherichia coli to alcohol-based disinfectants or ultraviolet irradiation and the diffusion rate of ethanol were determined in artificial mucus or sputum samples obtained from 27 individuals with acute upper respiratory infection. Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate >10%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient >0.7, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P < 0.001 for all). In contrast, complete inactivation was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation independently of mucus viscosity. Thus, mucus viscosity contributes to resistance of pathogens to alcohol-based disinfectants by decreasing the alcohol diffusion rate. These findings can provide a basis for developing new strategies, including improved disinfectants, for overcoming HAI.","2017-10-13","2020-05-24 19:00:37","2020-05-24 19:00:39","2020-05-24 19:00:37","13186","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/7N9CUL3Z/Hirose et al_2017_Viscosity is an important factor of resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/3EGHIJAR/s41598-017-13732-2.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The simplicity of the approach coupled with its far-reaching usefulness, create the powerful, popular method presented in The Finite Difference Time Domain Method for Electromagnetics. This volume offers timeless applications and formulations you can use to treat virtually any material type and geometry.The Finite Difference Time Domain Method for Electromagnetics explores the mathematical foundations of FDTD, including stability, outer radiation boundary conditions, and different coordinate systems. It covers derivations of FDTD for use with PEC, metal, lossy dielectrics, gyrotropic materials, and anisotropic materials. A number of applications are completely worked out with numerous figures to illustrate the results. It also includes a printed FORTRAN 77 version of the code that implements the technique in three dimensions for lossy dielectric materials. There are many methods for analyzing electromagnetic interactions for problem geometries. With The Finite Difference Time Domain Method for Electromagnetics, you will learn the simplest, most useful of these methods, from the basics through to the practical applications.","2018-05-04","2020-05-28 23:44:32","2020-05-28 23:44:32","","","340","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: j0taDwAAQBAJ","<p>Section 10.4 Lumped Circuit Elements</p> <p> </p>","","https://books.google.ca/books?id=j0taDwAAQBAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"RE2FVNRQ","journalArticle","1999","Mix, Jason; Dixon, Jonathan; Popovic, Zoya; Piket-May, Melinda","Incorporating non-linear lumped elements in FDTD: the equivalent source method","","","","10.1002/(SICI)1099-1204(199901/04)12:1/2<157::AID-JNM323>3.0.CO;2-V","","A new approach is presented for modelling three-dimensional lumped elements in the ""nite-di!erence time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations. The ""nite-di!erence equations for the lumped element's circuit behaviour are derived to produce discrete relationships between the device's terminal currents and voltages. These di!erence equations are then implemented in the FDTD grid with equivalent voltage and current sources based on static ""eld approximations. The method can be used for a wide range of applications which include lumped elements that may be passive, active, linear, non-linear, single, and multiple port devices. The underlying advantages of modelling a lumped element in this manner as compared to the more traditional extended FDTD technique is that the lumped element is easily extended across multiple FDTD cells and the need for a separate transcendental equation solver is eliminated. The method is demonstrated by a speci""c example based on the Curtice}Cubic non-linear model for a MESFET. The s-parameters from an FDTD simulation are compared to the manufacturer's measured data and to results from simulations using Hewlett-Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS). Finally, the method is used to model the MESFET in a three port oscillator.

One aspect of this application is accurately and efficiently modeling antenna and microstrip feeds within the constraints of FDTD approximations. Several relatively straightforward approaches have been suggested, including gap and frill feeds. More complicated approaches, which involve including the coaxial feed cable in the FDTD calculation space, have also been suggested. A related aspect is the desirability of reducing the number of time steps required for FDTD calculations to converge, especially for transient excitation. In this paper we illustrate that for many geometries a simple gap model with an internal source resistance provides accurate results while greatly reducing the number of time steps required for convergence.","1996-07","2020-05-31 16:20:36","2020-05-31 16:20:36","2020-05-31 16:20:36","1000-1005","","7","44","","IEEE Trans.

"98FJL3AP","journalArticle","","Müller, Rafael; Kornblith, Simon; Hinton, Geoffrey E","When does label smoothing help?","","","","","","The generalization and learning speed of a multi-class neural network can often be signiﬁcantly improved by using soft targets that are a weighted average of the hard targets and the uniform distribution over labels. Smoothing the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming over-conﬁdent and label smoothing has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classiﬁcation, language translation and speech recognition. Despite its widespread use, label smoothing is still poorly understood. Here we show empirically that in addition to improving generalization, label smoothing improves model calibration which can signiﬁcantly improve beam-search. However, we also observe that if a teacher network is trained with label smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much less effective. To explain these observations, we visualize how label smoothing changes the representations learned by the penultimate layer of the network. We show that label smoothing encourages the representations of training examples from the same class to group in tight clusters. This results in loss of information in the logits about resemblances between instances of different classes, which is necessary for distillation, but does not hurt generalization or calibration of the model’s predictions.","","2020-06-05 17:59:24","2020-06-05 17:59:25","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RXVR46SD/Müller et al. - When does label smoothing help.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During dehiscence, mechanical energy stored in specialized tissues is transferred to the seeds to increase their kinetic and potential energies. The resulting seed dispersal patterns have been investigated in some ballistic dispersers, but the mechanical performance of a launch mechanism of this type has not been measured. The properties of the energy storage tissue and the energy transfer efficiency of the launch mechanism were quantified in Impatiens capensis. In this species the valves forming the seed pod wall store mechanical energy. Their mass specific energy storage capacity (124 J kg−1) was comparable with that of elastin and spring steel. The energy storage capacity of the pod tissues was determined by their level of hydration, suggesting a role for turgor pressure in the energy storage mechanism. During dehiscence the valves coiled inwards, collapsing the pod and ejecting the seeds. Dehiscence took 4.2±0.4 ms (mean ±SEM, n=13). The estimated efficiency with which energy was transferred to the seeds was low (0.51±0.26%, mean ±SEM, n=13). The mean seed launch angle (17.4±5.2, mean ±SEM, n=45) fell within the range predicted by a ballistic model to maximize dispersal distance. Low ballistic dispersal efficiency or effectiveness may be characteristic of species that also utilize secondary seed dispersal mechanisms.","2009-05","2020-06-05 23:40:56","2020-06-05 23:40:56","2020-06-05 23:40:55","2045-2053","","7","60","","J Exp Bot","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 19321647 PMCID: PMC2682495","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/4YJD9H39/Hayashi et al_2009_The mechanics of explosive seed dispersal in orange jewelweed (Impatiens.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682495/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measurements made on day 1 were treated with caution because of heterogeneity in rectal temperatures taken before exposure between the groups of mice given different treatments. On days 6 and 12, rectal temperatures rose by approximately 1°C in mice sham exposed, or exposed to 1 W m−2 or 100 W m−2. Only in the group of mice exposed to 400 W m−2 was the mean rise in rectal temperature during exposure (about 3°C) significantly increased above the sham value. In groups killed 2–3 days after treatment (mainly meiotic exposure) frequencies of chromosome aberrations in spermatocytes showed no significant heterogeneity although the highest frequency of 1·5 per cent was at the highest (400 W m−2 power density. Another group killed 30 days after 100 W m−2 exposures (spermatogonial sampling) showed no significant increase over controls in chromosome aberration frequency. There was a small but significant increase in sperm count with increasing power density in mice killed 12–13 days after exposure, but a non-significant one in those exposed as spermatogonia (killed 41 days later).

In a study of 225 publications, in which we sought to determine a possible association between the funding source(s), quality and outcome in a total of 2,160 genetic damage assessment tests of mammalian cells exposed to RF energy, we made several observations. One finding was that a great majority of researchers had acknowledged government agencies as the funding source (53%, 120 of 225 publications), while a small number of scientists mentioned mobile phone industry as the financial source (9%, 20 of 225 publications). Numerous investigators did not mention the funding source (26%, 58 of 225 publications). Secondly, industry-funded investigations were of better quality and utilized quality control measures, i.e., blind evaluation, adequate description of dosimetry, positive controls and/or sham-exposed controls, compared to those funded by the government. Another observation was that in industry-funded studies, the d values (effect size or standardized mean difference between the cells exposed to RF energy and sham-exposed controls) were consistently lower than in government-funded studies. In addition, compared to government-funded studies, a higher percentage of industry-funded studies reported no difference in genetic damage between RF- and sham-exposed cells (80% for industry-funded studies versus 49% for government-funded studies). Finally, we observed that industry-funded studies were less likely to report an increase in genetic damage in cells exposed to RF energy (10%) compared to government-funded studies (23%). In view of the large difference between the percentage of publications funded by government and industry (53% or 122 of 225 publications for government, compared to 9% or 29 of 225 publications for industry), caution should be used when debating and discussing the above observations. Overall, it is important to include the quality control measures in the investigations, and also mention the funding source in published studies.","2019","2020-06-07 15:31:02","2020-06-07 15:31:02","","353-362","","4","192","","Radiat.

The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200-222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200-222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.","2017","2020-06-07 15:33:57","2020-06-07 15:33:57","","483-491","","4","187","","Radiat.

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature.

However, the fabrication of the moulds to produce microfluidic devices, such as SU-8 moulds, usually requires a cleanroom environment that can be quite costly. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop low-cost alternatives for the fabrication of microstructures, avoiding the use of cleanroom facilities. Recently, low-cost techniques without cleanroom facilities that feature aspect ratios more than 20, for fabricating those SU-8 moulds have been gaining popularity among biomedical research community. In those techniques, Ultraviolet (UV) exposure equipment, commonly used in the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) industry, replaces the more expensive and less available Mask Aligner that has been used in the last 15 years for SU-8 patterning. Alternatively, non-lithographic low-cost techniques, due to their ability for large-scale production, have increased the interest of the industrial and research community to develop simple, rapid and low-cost microfluidic structures. These alternative techniques include Print and Peel methods (PAP), laserjet, solid ink, cutting plotters or micromilling, that use equipment available in almost all laboratories and offices. An example is the xurography technique that uses a cutting plotter machine and adhesive vinyl films to generate the master moulds to fabricate microfluidic channels. In this review, we present a selection of the most recent lithographic and non-lithographic low-cost techniques to fabricate microfluidic structures, focused on the features and limitations of each technique. Only microfabrication methods that do not require the use of cleanrooms are considered. Additionally, potential applications of these microfluidic devices in biomedical engineering are presented with some illustrative examples.","2016-07-26","2020-06-08 17:16:40","2020-06-08 17:16:55","2020-06-08 17:16:40","2280-2292","","11","49","","Journal of Biomechanics","Biomedical microfluidic devices by using low-cost fabrication techniques","Selected Articles from the International Conference on CFD in Medicine and Biology (Albufeira, Portugal – August 30th - September 4th, 2015)","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/JDNE9G39/Faustino et al_2016_Biomedical microfluidic devices by using low-cost fabrication techniques.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/6CI6SMIT/S0021929015006739.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The device uses an electrokinetic process, induced charge electroosmosis [17], by which a ﬂow through the device is driven by a set of charged obstacles in it. Its design is realized by manipulating the shape and orientation of the obstacles in order to maximize the amount of ﬂuid mixing within the device. The computation entails the solution of a constrained optimization problem in which function evaluations require the numerical solution of a set of partial diﬀerential equations: a potential equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and a mass transport equation. The most expensive component of the function evaluation (which must be performed at every step of an iteration for the optimization) is the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that by using some new robust algorithms for this task [11, 16], based on certain preconditioners that take advantage of the structure of the linearized problem, this computation can be done eﬃciently. Using this computational strategy, in conjunction with a derivative-free pattern search algorithm for the optimization, applied to a ﬁnite element discretization of the problem, we are able to determine optimal conﬁgurations of microﬂuidic devices.","2011-02-10","2020-06-08 17:26:07","2020-06-08 17:26:07","2020-06-08 17:26:07","383-404","","4","65","","Int.

"UQIGCSER","journalArticle","","See, C H; Abd-Alhameed, R A; Excell, P S","Electromagnetic Modelling of Biological Cells Using Lumped Element-FDTD","","","","","","The standard Finite-difference Time-domain (FDTD) method requires extremely small time-step sizes when modelling scattering objects that are large compared with the wavelength. This is especially so in modelling biological cells having sizes of the order of a few tens of micrometers. This can become impractical due to the unaffordable computation times required. This problem can be overcome by implementing a quasi-static approximate version of FDTD, based on transferring the working frequency to a higher frequency, to reduce the number of time steps required. Then, the generated internal field at the higher frequency can be scaled back to the frequency of interest. This paper presents an approach to modelling and analysis of the HH (Hodgkin and Huxley) membrane model that is represented as an electrical circuit on the surface of a biological equivalent spherical cell. Since the external medium of the biological cell is lossy material, a modified Berenger perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition is used to truncate the computation grid. The total fields of the simulated structures have been shown to give reasonable and stable result at 900 and 1800 MHz.","","2020-06-09 19:55:33","2020-06-09 19:55:46","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/EJ57IDVQ/See et al. - Electromagnetic Modelling of Biological Cells Usin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The structure of DNAFETs is similar to that of MOSFETs, with the exception of the gate structure which, in DNAFETs, is replaced by a layer of immobilized ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) molecules which act as surface receptors. When complementary DNA strands hybridize to the receptors, the charge distribution near the surface changes, which in turn modulates current transport through the semiconductor transducer. Arrays of DNAFETs can be used for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (causing many hereditary diseases) and for DNA sequencing. Their main advantage compared to optical detection methods in common use today is that they do not require labeling of molecules. Furthermore, they work continuously and (near) real-time.

But, over the past several years SiGeC BiCMOS technology has pushed GaAs out of many of these sockets due to it’s high performance, high level of integration, and low cost attributes. Will this trend continue to the power amplifier? Is this technology really cheaper to develop and manufacture RF product solutions than GaAs? Is SiGeC really the RF technology of the future, or only a short-lived fad to be pushed aside by RF CMOS?

Therefore, understanding the particle movement is important for infection control. Images of a sneeze induced by nasal cavity stimulation by healthy adult volunteers, were taken by a digital high-vision, high-speed video system equipped with a computer system and treated as a research model. The obtained images were enhanced electronically, converted to digital images every 1/300 s, and subjected to vector analysis of the bioparticles contained in the whole sneeze cloud using automatic image processing software. The initial velocity of the particles or their clusters in the sneeze was greater than 6 m/s, but decreased as the particles moved forward; the momentums of the particles seemed to be lost by 0.15–0.20 s and started a diffusion movement. An approximate equation of a function of elapsed time for their velocity was obtained from the vector analysis to represent the dynamics of the front-line particles. This methodology was also applied for a cough. Microclouds contained in a smoke exhaled with a voluntary cough by a volunteer after smoking one breath of cigarette, were traced as the visible, aerodynamic surrogates for invisible bioparticles of cough. The smoke cough microclouds had an initial velocity greater than 5 m/s. The fastest microclouds were located at the forefront of cloud mass that moving forward; however, their velocity clearly decreased after 0.05 s and they began to diffuse in the environmental airflow. The maximum direct reaches of the particles and microclouds driven by sneezing and coughing unaffected by environmental airflows were estimated by calculations using the obtained equations to be about 84 cm and 30 cm from the mouth, respectively, both achieved in about 0.2 s, suggesting that data relating to the dynamics of sneeze and cough became available by calculation.","2013-11-27","2020-06-17 14:46:57","2020-06-17 14:46:58","2020-06-17 14:46:57","e80244","","11","8","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/BBQCU5I4/file.pdf","","","","Harrod, Kevin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was shown that the lowest film porosity was obtained from a suspension containing 20 wt.% alumina powder at the lowest applied voltage (30 V), for a longer deposition time (10 min) using a suspension temperature of 30 ºC.

The combined properties of the ﬂuid and the elastomeric substrate result in a ﬂexible and durable antenna that is well suited for conformal antenna applications. Injecting the metal into microﬂuidic channels provides a simple way to deﬁne the shape of the liquid, which is stabilized mechanically by a thin oxide skin that forms spontaneously on its surface. This approach has proven sufﬁcient for forming simple, single layer antenna geometries, such as dipoles. More complex ﬂuidic antennas, particularly those featuring large, co-planar sheet-like geometries, require additional design considerations to achieve the desired shape of the metal. Here, a multi-layer patch antenna is fabricated using specially designed serpentine channels that take advantage of the unique rheological properties of the liquid metal alloy. The ﬂexibility of the resulting antennas is demonstrated and the antenna parameters are characterized through simulation and measurement in both the relaxed and ﬂexed states.","2012-05","2020-06-22 17:48:55","2020-06-22 17:48:55","2020-06-22 17:48:55","2151-2156","","5","60","","IEEE Trans.

The method allows for rapid impedance measurement for a range of frequencies using a narrow input pulse, digital oscilloscope and FFT techniques.

One of the most important properties computed for a transmission line is its characteristic impedance, which is often used in the extraction of the equivalent circuit model of an interconnection discontinuity. The calculation of the characteristic impedance from FDTD numerical results seems to be trivial it can simply be obtained by the ratio of the Fourier transformed voltage and the Fourier transformed current. However, it is shown that, if the characteristic impedance is not calculated properly, significant amount of error can be introduced in its numerical solution.","1994-06","2020-06-24 03:23:04","2020-06-24 03:23:04","","1814-1817 vol.3","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/Q5GUEEE9/408185.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VDJGMXEK/Jiayuan Fang and Danwei Xue - 1994 - Precautions in the calculation of impedance in FDT.pdf","","","Impedance; electric impedance; Finite difference methods; finite difference time-domain analysis; finite-difference time-domain; Time domain analysis; characteristic impedance; Distributed parameter circuits; Electronics packaging; electronics packaging interconnects; equivalent circuit model; Equivalent circuits; FDTD computations; FDTD numerical results; Fourier transformed current; Fourier transformed voltage; integrated circuit interconnections; Integrated circuit interconnections; Integrated circuit modeling; interconnection discontinuity; microwave integrated circuits; Microwave integrated circuits; Microwave theory and techniques; numerical solution; packaging; ratio; transmission line; transmission line theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium and URSI National Radio Science Meeting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First elastic solutions are derived for rods, for elliptical-shaped flat disks and for ellipsoidal solid bodies spinning about their sideways axes. Then the spins for first plastic yield are found in each case using each of the Tresca and the von Mises yield conditions. Then upper and lower bounds on the maximum allowable limit spins where the body would globally fail assuming perfectly plastic behavior are derived. The elastic solutions at first yield always give a lower bound to that limit spin, but global failure generally does not occur until the spin is increased. A way to calculate an improved lower bound is illustrated. Upper bounds are found in a simple and new way. The method uses the fact that the volume-averaged stresses can be calculated directly from the loadings without the need for any actual stress solutions, and then it is proved that the use of those average stresses in the yield functions always gives an upper bound to the limit loads. That use of the statically determinate average stresses to obtain meaningful plastic upper bounds to limit loads is though to be a new method, and can be applied to any shape. Finally, several finite element calculations are used to determine the quantitative relations between the lower and upper bounds and the actual limit spins for ellipsoidal bodies. The results are of interest in the spin of planetary bodies, where they explain the nature of an average-stress approximate method, and in the analysis of spinning bodies in general. In addition, the approach gives a very interesting example of the utility of the limit analysis approaches of plasticity theories.","2008-10-01","2020-06-26 17:49:06","2020-06-26 17:49:06","2020-06-26 17:49:06","733-742","","8","43","","International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics","Spinning rods, elliptical disks and solid ellipsoidal bodies","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/9I4CZ34B/Holsapple_2008_Spinning rods, elliptical disks and solid ellipsoidal bodies.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/64EISDGJ/S0020746208000644.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For large cysts of Aiptasia we calculated that the internal concentration of protons and protonated carboxyl groups is about 5 M. Cysts contain polyacids in a high concentration. At a low pH several of the carboxyl groups of the polymer are uncharged. The carboxyl groups dissociate when, on triggering, the proton concentration becomes balanced across the cyst membrane. The speed of protons in water is extremely rapid. Thus, the equilibration of the proton concentration initially results in a negative net charge within the cyst and therefore in a sudden electrostatic repulsion between the dissociated carboxyl groups of the polymer. This causes an increase in the pressure of the matrix against the cyst wall. We suggest that this nonosmotic pressure increase causes the first and extremely rapid step of discharge. We propose that in a second step cations and water are taken up, generating an increase in osmotic pressure. A change in the pH value may also facilitate the invagination and evagination, respectively, of the tubule.","2006-09-01","2020-06-29 04:05:26","2020-06-29 04:05:26","2020-06-29 04:05:26","180-188","","3","60","","Helgol Mar Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/GX4VV9VW/Berking_Herrmann_2006_Formation and discharge of nematocysts is controlled by a proton gradient.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is emphasized that an appropriate discussion of the experimental results with regard to nonthermal effects must frequently consider thermal effects as well. The amount of energy transfer from the radiation to the material varies slowly with frequency and is largely governed by the dielectric loss. Within reasonable limits, this loss is proportional to the intensity of the radiation. Nonthermal effects, on the other hand, occur in certain frequency regions only, and usually exhibit saturation at rather low intensity. As a consequence, nonthermal effects might be drowned by the thermal ones. This is in particular to be expected when the sign of the considered effect in the nonthermal region is opposite to that of the thermal effect. As an example, consider the reduction of the rate of growth of certain bacteria arising from irradiation at 73.6 Hz as discussed. Temperature increase, on the other hand, increases the rate of growth, thus canceling the nonthermal effect at sufficiently high intensity.","1980-01-01","2020-06-29 04:59:11","2020-06-29 04:59:11","2020-06-29 04:59:11","85-152","","","53","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/S0065-2539(08)60259-0","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/KYE57A2I/S0065253908602590.html","","","","Marton, L.; Marton, C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this study was to measure the lengths of the right and left main bronchi and their anteroposterior (AP) and transverse (TR) diameters using the 3D and two-dimensional (2D) images in the same adult respectively, and to evaluate the degree of correlation between them. Methods We measured the lengths of the right and left main bronchi from the carina to the first of their branches and the AP and TR diameters at the mid-portion of the right main bronchus and 2 cm below the carina in the left main bronchus. We determined the size of the left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT) based on the measured AP diameter of the left main bronchus from the 3D and 2D images, respectively. Results There was moderate correlation between the lengths of both main bronchi obtained from the 3D images and the 2D images, and between the AP diameter of the left main bronchus obtained from the 3D images and the 2D images. Same sized DLTs were estimated in 69% of the men and 34% of the women. Conclusions The lengths of the right and left main bronchi and their AP and TR diameters obtained from 3D images were not strongly correlated with those from 2D images. Therefore, a further study is needed to verify the superiority of 3D images in selecting the appropriate size of left-sided DLT.","2014-03","2020-06-29 17:44:18","2020-06-29 17:44:21","2020-06-29 17:44:18","189-194","","3","66","","Korean J Anesthesiol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24729839 PMCID: PMC3983413","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/48BEUWVF/Lee et al_2014_The comparison of the lengths and diameters of main bronchi measured from.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3983413/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent mouse studies show that avidity for host cells can play an important role in polyclonal antibody escape, and further that electrostatic charge of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein can contribute to such avidity. Methodology/Principal Findings We test the role of glycoprotein charge on sequence data from the three major subtypes of influenza A in humans, using a simple method of calculating net glycoprotein charge. Of all subtypes, H3N2 in humans shows a striking pattern of increasing positive charge since its introduction in 1968. Notably, this trend applies to both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins. In the late 1980s hemagglutinin charge reached a plateau, while neuraminidase charge started to decline. We identify key groups of amino acid sites involved in this charge trend. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge these are the first indications that, for human H3N2, net glycoprotein charge covaries strongly with antigenic drift on a global scale. Further work is needed to elucidate how such charge interacts with other immune escape mechanisms, such as glycosylation, and we discuss important questions arising for future study.","2010-12-30","2020-06-29 20:22:05","2020-06-29 20:22:05","2020-06-29 20:22:05","e15674","","12","5","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/5Z74E722/Arinaminpathy_Grenfell_2010_Dynamics of Glycoprotein Charge in the Evolutionary History of Human Influenza.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/2CZI7GNP/article.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed LNA also has the capability for the simultaneous improvement of noise figure (NF) and linearity. In addition, we analyzed and verified that the second-order interaction, which affects the third-order nonlinearity, becomes less sensitive to the low-frequency input termination at higher bias currents. The possibility of removing the low-frequency LC trap is investigated based on this analysis. We also show that LNAs with smaller base and/or smaller emitter resistances require lower source impedance at low frequencies to improve linearity by the same amount. Finally, prudent layouts for improving the performance of the LNA are considered. Eleven design examples of the proposed LNA, which individually operate at 880, 1575, or 1960 MHz, are fabricated in a low-cost 0.35- μm SiGe BiCMOS process to verify the design and analysis experimentally. The fabricated LNAs have excellent performances, especially in NF.

To reach watt-level output power from a single-chip CMOS PA, two main strategies can be identified: use of high supply voltage, and use of matching and power combination. High supply voltage limits are closely related to device design in the fabrication process. However, the maximum operating voltage can be improved by amplifier class selection, circuit solutions, and process modifications or mask changes. High output power can also be reached by the use of on-chip matching and power combination, commonly using on-chip transformers. Reliability often sets the limits for the PA design, and PA degradation mechanisms are reviewed.

The most striking physiochemical feature of the N protein of SARS-CoV is that it is a typical basic protein with a high predicted pI and high hydrophilicity, which is consistent with its function of binding to the ribophosphate backbone of the RNA molecule. The predicted high extent of phosphorylation of the N protein on multiple candidate phosphorylation sites demonstrates that it would be related to important functions, such as RNA-binding and localization to the nucleolus of host cells. Subsequent study shows that there is an SR-rich region in the N protein and this region might be involved in the protein-protein interaction. The abundant antigenic sites predicted in the N protein, as well as experimental evidence with synthesized polypeptides, indicate that the N protein is one of the major antigens of the SARS-CoV.

This required focusing time delay has been modified from the current formulation to incorporate either an odd or even number of elements. A brief procedure leading to the derivation of the pressure distribution for beam focusing is described, which gives rise to an unclosed form. Consequently, a numerical method is desirable for the analysis of beam focusing. Using this approach, beam directivity and pressure distributions are studied to predict the behavior of focusing as compared to steering. This shows a benefit of focusing over steering within the near field of the array, and that the directivity of focusing converges to that of steering in the far field.","2000-04-01","2020-07-03 23:21:05","2020-07-16 06:57:36","2020-07-03 23:21:05","189-198","","3","33","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","tex.ids: azarBeamFocusingBehavior2000","<p>Simplifying, a general solution for the required element focus-<br />ing delays can be written as:</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/3A565JAZ/main.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/7RWWRUW7/Azar et al. - 2000 - Beam focusing behavior of linear phased arrays.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/EXSA6TY8/S0963869599000432.html","","","Beam directivity; Dynamic focusing; Imaging; Numerical simulation; Ultrasonic phased array transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HJUN9WQV","journalArticle","","Knight, David W","Diode detectors for RF measurement","Rectifier circuits","","","","","This article addresses the subject of RF signal detection from the point of view of those who design and calibrate impedance matching bridges and other measuring instruments operating in the HF and VHF radio ranges. The principal discussion relates to the simple diode peak-detector; and covers the different possible circuit configurations, the associated theory, and the numerical methods needed for data analysis. Circuit techniques used to linearise the diode detector output are to be discussed in a separate document. Analysis of the detector transfer characteristic for sinusoidal input shows that the AC-induced error term involves the zero-order modified Bessel function of the first kind (I0). This result is not new, but it is often disregarded. The dynamic contribution is quite unlike the error that occurs for DC input, regardless of any compensatory modification of circuit parameters; which means that linearity correction schemes using a reference diode to produce a DC amplifier with a complementary gain law can never be perfect. It is also shown however, that the AC error is independent of frequency provided that the smoothing capacitor is 'large'. This means that the tracking detector system, which involves automatic self-calibration against a low-frequency precision rectifier, is theoretically sound. By considering the power dissipated in the detector, it is shown that the input impedance can be calculated using first and zero-order modified Bessel functions of the first kind (I0 and I1). This allows the determination of detector transfer-functions that take source impedance into account. When this facility is combined with the ability to calculate the dynamic component of the peak detection error, a measurement of DC output taken with a calibrated voltmeter can be converted into a measurement of AC input without the need for an AC reference. The computation procedures required are not simple, but they are described in detail and given as Basic algorithms readily adaptable to any programming environment.","","2020-07-05 02:08:05","2020-07-05 02:08:05","","116","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/D9VTDF8Z/Knight - Diode detectors for RF measurement.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"TYW68LIG","journalArticle","","Knight, David W","Impedance and admittance measurement using discrete scalar voltage samples","","","","","","The resistive and reactive components of an impedance, including the sign of the reactance, can be determined by placing a resistance and a reactance in series with the impedance and making five scalar voltage measurements across pairs of points in the resulting network. It is also possible, using suitable combinations of the same 5 measurements, to determine impedance magnitude, phase tangent, conductance, susceptance, power factor, and (by making the reference resistance equal to the target load resistance) reflection coefficient and SWR. This article gives expressions for all of these quantities; and includes an error analysis in each instance to show how a standard deviation can be calculated. The error functions are well-behaved except for those related to the voltage reflection coefficient, the expression for which is not differentiable when its value is in the region of zero. A solution to that problem is to place a potential divider across the generator and make an additional bridge voltage measurement, this configuration being the same as is used in antenna analysers and return loss bridges. Although not suitable for permanent insertion into a transmission line; the series network can be used for simultaneous determination of load resistance, conductance and phase tangent, as is required for guaranteed convergence of impedance matching procedures involving series and parallel reactances.","","2020-07-05 02:17:55","2020-07-05 02:17:55","","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/XACS5V4N/Knight - Impedance and admittance measurement using discret.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For signals with peak amplitudes larger than some hundred mV the non-linear forward voltage of the diodes is compensated by a simple network using signals from two peak detectors, one with a single and the second with two diodes in series.

"9ZQGJ2HI","journalArticle","","Li, Liang","Radiation noise source modeling and near-field coupling estimation in RF interference","","","","","","With increasing complexities and shrinking size of modern electronic devices, the near-field RF interference issues are becoming challenging for RF-digital mixed circuit design. Predicting the coupling from digital module to RF antennas and mitigating RF interference is important to the system performance. The ultimate goal of this study is to address the desensitization issues existing in modern electronic devices that have mixed high speed digital-RF circuits, such as cellphone and wearable devices. In order to estimate the near-field noise coupling from digital module to RF antennas, the noise source is anticipated to be replaced by its equivalent radiation model which can facilitate the near-field coupling analysis. This thesis focuses on modeling of radiation noise source and its application in RF interference applications. Two methods are proposed, equivalent dipole moment model and Huygens’s equivalent model. The methodology of both methods will be introduced and later validated with full-wave simulation and measurement. Dipole moment model is extracted by Least-square and improved with global optimization, while Huygens’s equivalent model is constructed in full-wave simulation tool. With equivalent noise source model, the near-field coupling between radiation noise source and RF antennas are estimated by either direct simulation or reciprocity theorem. Field data is obtained by near-field scanning with phase information. Measurement data shows good correlation and consistence for noise source modeling and near-field coupling.","","2020-07-08 14:11:33","2020-07-08 14:12:05","","77","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>Neat technique to speed up field sim; measure H currents on the surface of a simulation of the patch antenna, then create some number of Huygen sources that represent those currents.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is possible to determine these currents analytically for rectangular patches; see [Ai]</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/9F3BYF5F/viewcontent.pdf","","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transient field phenomena for each of the Floquet mode expansion were analyzed. The solution reduces to the case of far-zone field radiation by moving the focus point to the far zone.

This method utilizes near-field data to determine an equivalent magnetic current source over a fictitious surface which encompasses the antenna. This magnetic current, once determined, can be used to ascertain the near and the far fields. This method demonstrates that once the values of the electromagnetic field are known over an arbitrary geometry, its values for any other region can be obtained. An electric field integral equation is developed to relate the near fields to the equivalent magnetic current. A moment method procedure is employed to solve the integral equation by transforming it into a matrix equation. A least squares solution via singular value decomposition is used to solve the matrix equation. Computations with both synthetic and experimental data, where the near field of several antenna configurations are measured over various geometric surfaces, illustrate the accuracy of this method.

Uniform excitation gives comparable axial and transverse subsidiary lobes, and is probably the best choice. Focal shift, where the peak axial power density occurs between the aperture and the phase (geometric) focus, due to the1/R^2factor, is accurately calculated for a uniform square aperture.

Our paper begins by outlining a simple model for studying transmission lines embedded in SVAMs. We then present our design and experimental results to confirm the concept. 1.","","2020-07-09 19:02:57","2020-07-09 19:02:58","","2013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","","<p>FDM 3D printed titanium dioxide metamaterial!</p> <p> </p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/MGUAYS36/summary.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ZYZRB5S2/Rumpf et al_Electromagnetic Isolation of A Microstrip by Embedding in a Spatially Variant.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer and thermoplastics are the two major polymer materials used in microﬂuidics. The fabrication of PDMS and thermoplastic microﬂuidic device can be categorized as front-end polymer microchannel fabrication and post-end microﬂuidic bonding procedures, respectively. PDMS and thermoplastic materials each have unique advantages and their use is indispensable in polymer microﬂuidics. Therefore, the proper selection of polymer microfabrication is necessary for the successful application of microfluidics. In this paper, we give a short overview of polymer microfabrication methods for microfluidics and discuss current challenges and future opportunities for research in polymer microfluidics fabrication. We summarize standard approaches, as well as state-of-art polymer microfluidic fabrication methods. Currently, the polymer microfluidic device is at the stage of technology transition from research labs to commercial production. Thus, critical consideration is also required with respect to the commercialization aspects of fabricating polymer microﬂuidics. This article provides easy-to-understand illustrations and targets to assist the research community in selecting proper polymer microfabrication strategies in microﬂuidics.","2016-12-10","2020-07-10 01:30:30","2020-07-10 01:30:33","2020-07-10 01:30:30","225","","12","7","","Micromachines","Polymer Microfluidics","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/VJZPQXMT/Tsao - 2016 - Polymer Microfluidics Simple, Low-Cost Fabricatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The electrode interface impedance components (R/sub i/, X/sub i/) and the culture medium component R/sub m/ were separated by making use of the Warburg's model frequency dependent properties. Measurements were carried out from 18 Hz to 18 kHz with a constant current impedance bridge as growth proceeded. Growth curves for R/sub i/ and X/sub i/ showed a similar temporal pattern within the frequency range of 18-100 Hz. Dispersion was not observed in R/sub m/, meaning that the same growth response was obtained within the 18-18000-Hz range. At low frequency, the resistive and capacitive reactive components, or R/sub i/ and X/sub b/, respectively, were directly measured, where R/sub b/=(2*R/sub i/+R/sub m/) and X/sub b/=2*X/sub i/ and, above 5 kHz, R/sub m/ was obtained (for Z/sub i/ is negligible). Thus, R/sub i/ was easily discriminated from R/sub m/ by simple arithmetic. In four experiments, the maximum spread of X/sub i/, R/sub i/, and R/sub m/ was smaller than 5% indicating good repeatability. There is potential new information in dissecting out the growth curve in three separate component curves.<>","1992-12","2020-07-10 01:35:41","2020-07-10 01:35:42","","1310-1313","","12","39","","","Impedance bacteriometry","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/NTH2EFCV/Felice et al_1992_Impedance bacteriometry.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/ASI7N5MH/184708.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three subtypes of AI viruses with different complex refractive indexes (CRIs) were detected at the THz frequency regime. The optical properties of the viruses in the THz frequency range were first measured, and the real and imaginary parts of their CRI are also plotted to investigate the sensing/detecting applications. We observed the resonance frequency shift of the THz MM following the deposition of the viruses on the surface of the proposed design. As an RI sensing application, we show that, with placing different sensing materials in vicinity of the nano sensor/detector device, the reflected resonance frequency changes, which, in turn, leads to measuring the sensitivity of the nano sensor/detector to detect the AI viruses. We investigate the detection of three subtypes of AI viruses with different protein concentrations and different RI values. We observed the resonance-frequency shift of the THz nano bio-sensor/detector following the RI changing of the detected viruses. The resonance shift is higher for the H9N2 virus, which has a relatively large amount of real part of the RI. Thus, the frequency shift decreases with lower amount of the RI real part. Additionally, we show that the magnitude of the reflection spectrum will be enhanced in larger amount of imaginary parts of the RI. This results from a combination of size-related factors, leading to field enhancement accompanying strong field localization.","2019-07","2020-07-10 02:58:49","2020-07-10 02:58:49","","5161-5166","","13","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Sensors Journal","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/L3BD5C9H/8663385.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/RGDMSWVD/Keshavarz_Vafapour_2019_Sensing Avian Influenza Viruses Using Terahertz Metamaterial Reflector.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biomatter-wave interaction modalities are considered over a wide range of frequencies and applications such as detection of cancer biomarkers, biotin, neurotransmitters and heart rate are presented in detail. By treating biological tissue as a dielectric substance, having a unique dielectric signature, it can be characterized by frequency dependent parameters such as permittivity and conductivity. By observing the unique permittivity spectrum, cancerous cells can be distinguished from healthy ones or by measuring the changes in permittivity, concentration of medically relevant biomolecules such as glucose, neurotransmitters, vitamins and proteins, ailments and abnormalities can be detected. In case of optical biosensors, any change in permittivity is transduced to a change in optical properties such as photoluminescence, interference pattern, reflection intensity and reflection angle through techniques like quantum dots, interferometry, surface enhanced raman scattering or surface plasmon resonance. Conversely, in case of RF, MW, mmW and THz biosensors, capacitive sensing is most commonly employed where changes in permittivity are reflected as changes in capacitance, through components like interdigitated electrodes, resonators and microstrip structures. In this paper, interactions of EM waves with biomatter are considered, with an emphasis on a clear demarcation of various modalities, their underlying principles and applications.","2019-01","2020-07-10 03:01:34","2020-07-10 03:01:34","2020-07-10 03:01:34","1013","","5","19","","","EM-Wave Biosensors","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 5 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/HI7GKMYM/Mehrotra et al_2019_EM-Wave Biosensors.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/WEC9EDCA/1013.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While signiﬁcant research activity has been directed towards the formation of microﬂuidic components in a wide range of thermoplastics, sealing of these components is required for the formation of enclosed microchannels and other microﬂuidic elements, and thus bonding remains a critical step in any thermoplastic microfabrication process. Unlike silicon and glass, the diverse material properties of thermoplastics opens the door to an extensive array of substrate bonding options, together with a set of unique challenges which must be addressed to achieve optimal sealing results.

Surface hydrolysis was carried out by means of sodium hydroxide solutions, leading to the formation of carboxylate groups. Three commercial polyester films of 100 μm in thickness were used in this work: AryLite™, Mylar™, and Teonex™, hydrolysis time being the main modification parameter. FTIR-ATR analysis, topography and contact angle (CA) measurements, surface free energy (SFE) and T-Peel adhesion tests were carried out to characterize the modified films. A quantitative estimate of the carboxylates surface coverage as a function of treatment time was obtained through a supramolecular approach, i.e. the ionic self-assembly of a tetracationic porphyrin chromophore onto the film surface. The surface free energy and critical surface tension of the hydrolyzed polyesters was evaluated by means of Zisman, Saito, Berthelot and Owens-Wendt methods. It was shown that NaOH solution treatment increases roughness, polarity and surface free energy of polymers. As a result, T-Peel strengths for modified Mylar™ and Teonex™ films were respectively 2.2 and 1.8 times higher than that for the unmodified films, whereas AryLite™ adhesion test failed.</p></section>","2013-01-01","2020-07-11 22:20:16","2020-07-11 22:20:21","2020-07-11 22:20:16","35-45","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","Publisher: De Gruyter Section: Open Chemistry","<p>UV treatment and 30 minutes of NaOH exposure causes bonding - surface modification can be verified by wetting angle</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/CSYAMKF7/Cammarano et al. - 2013 - Surface modification and adhesion improvement of p.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/5ZTRRNI2/article-p35.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A laser-cutting method is applied to engrave structures in sheets of the tapes. After peeling off the tape liners, the structures could be easily integrated at room temperature with label-free optical waveguide biochips without further modifications or additional processing steps. It is shown that the well-defined and controllable height of the channels is advantageous for stopped-flow measurements of analyte binding. The easy fabrication of a fully transparent integrated sensor unit – tape cuvette system is also demonstrated for parallel microscopic investigations. The transparent unit was used to on-line monitor the surface adhesion of Salmonella cells on poly-l-lysine-coated biochip surfaces, followed by the straightforward microscopic visualization of the adhered bacterial cells. The material of the double sided tape is stable in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, its material is biocompatible, making it ideal for biological applications. Excellent, stable and reversible bonding of the microstructured tapes to biocompatible plastic and glass is also demonstrated. The simplicity of the fabrication at ambient temperatures makes the developed processes appealing for lab-on-a-chip applications, particularly if the bonded biochips are precious.","2014-06-01","2020-07-12 05:15:53","2020-07-12 05:15:53","2020-07-12 05:15:53","352-356","","","196","","Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","Microfluidic channels laser-cut in thin double-sided tapes","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p><span style=""color: #2e2e2e;

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of different sterilization techniques and to compare the characteristics of the material before and after sterilization of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microchips. For this, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) along with standard sterilization methods such as ultraviolet (UV), heat (autoclaving), ethylene oxide (EtO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were applied. The treated microchips were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Laser Scanning Microscopy in order to ascertain any changes in the chemical structure and surface morphology. The optimum sterilization parameters for SC-CO2 were elicited as 120bar, 40°C and 60min which provided complete sterility and did not alter the main properties of the polymer along with EtO and H2O2 sterilizations unlike heat and UV treatments. However, surface roughness and microchannel profiles were negatively affected. Although complete sterility was achieved, each protocol has its own strengths and weaknesses.","2016-01-01","2020-07-12 16:43:39","2020-07-12 16:43:39","2020-07-12 16:43:39","114-121","","","107","","The Journal of Supercritical Fluids","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Autoclaving pmma worked, though it went opaque.</p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/7QW9AXQV/S0896844615301091.html; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/A9WTF4I3/Yavuz et al_2016_Sterilization of PMMA microfluidic chips by various techniques and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore unsurprising that more and more microfluidic groups are investigating research using a wide range of thermoplastics which can be readily translated to large-scale manufacturing, if the technology is taken to commercialisation. While structuring, via additive or subtractive manufacturing, is becoming relatively easy through the use of commercial-grade devices, reliable and fast assembly remains a challenge. In this article, we propose an innocuous and cost-effective, under 2-min technique which enables the bonding of multiple poly(methyl methacrylate) layers. This bonding technique relies on the application of small amounts (10 µl/cm2) of ethanol, low temperatures (70 °C) and relatively low pressures (~1.6 MPa). Our characterisation analysis shows that using a bonding time of 2 min is enough to produce a strong bond able to withstand pressures always above 6.2 MPa (with mean of 8 MPa, highest reported in the literature), with minimal channel deformation (<5%). This technique, which we demonstrate on assembly comprising up to 19 layers, presents an exciting improvement in the field of rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices, enabling extremely fast design cycles in microfluidic research with a material compatible with mass manufacturing, thus allowing a smoother transition from the laboratory to the market. Beyond the research community, this robust prototyping technique has the potential to impact on the deliverability of other scientific endeavours including educational projects and will directly fuel the fluidic maker movement.","2016-11-25","2020-07-12 16:57:26","2020-07-12 16:57:26","2020-07-12 16:57:26","164","","12","20","","Microfluid Nanofluid","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;""><span> </span>This bonding technique relies on the application of small amounts (10 µl/cm</span><sup style=""box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 13.5px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"">2</sup><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #fcfcfc; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"">) of ethanol, low temperatures (70 °C) and relatively low pressures (~1.6 MPa).<span> </span></span></p>","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/H6852D64/Liga et al_2016_Safe and cost-effective rapid-prototyping of multilayer PMMA microfluidic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This technical note focuses on wavelength, illumination geometry and skin tone and their effect on the energy density (fluence) distribution within tissue. Monte Carlo modelling is one of the most widely used stochastic methods for the modelling of light transport in turbid biological media such as human skin. Using custom Monte Carlo simulation software of a multi-layered skin model, fluence distributions are produced for various non-ionising radiation combinations. Fluence distributions were analysed using Matlab mathematical software. Penetration depth increases with increasing wavelength with a maximum penetration depth of 5378 μm calculated. The calculations show that a 10-mm beam width produces a fluence level at target depths of 1–3 mm equal to 73–88% (depending on depth) of the fluence level at the same depths produced by an infinitely wide beam of equal incident fluence. Meaning little additional penetration is achieved with larger spot sizes. Fluence distribution within tissue and thus the treatment efficacy depends upon the illumination geometry and wavelength. To optimise therapeutic techniques, light-tissue interactions must be thoroughly understood and can be greatly supported by the use of mathematical modelling techniques.","2017","2020-07-13 17:59:41","2020-07-13 17:59:45","2020-07-13 17:59:41","1909-1918","","8","32","","Lasers Med Sci","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 28900751 PMCID: PMC5653719","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/C5Y2QM2W/Ash et al. - 2017 - Effect of wavelength and beam width on penetration.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5653719/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report a microfluidic long-term oxygenator which can support high-throughput parallel cell cultures under multiple defined oxygenation conditions (0 ppm – 42 ppm). An array of oxygen-nitrogen gas micro-mixers is developed and fabricated in the device to generate stable oxygen concentrations for the oxygenation process. A water-jacket layer located between the gas layer and the cell culture chamber is applied to block evaporation and maintain conditions of culture media in the chamber. Furthermore, we perform simulations and experiments to investigate the functions of the gas mixers and the water jackets. We also conduct culture experiments to study the long-term growth (up to one week) and aggregation of three selected dental bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Fusobacterium nucleatum) under ranges of oxygenation conditions. These particular results can provide important insights on their roles in the dental biofilm formation. Overall, this work demonstrates that the long-term microfluidic oxygenation approach can effectively regulate defined dissolved-oxygen levels in cell microenvironments. Importantly, this oxygenation approach can be further applied to general long-term analyses of cells for their behavioral, metabolic and genetic responses, and their biofilm formation processes.","","2020-07-13 23:37:08","2020-07-13 23:37:09","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<p>7.

Sensors consisting of an oxygen-sensitive dye embedded in the fluid channels permit dynamic fluorescence-based monitoring of the DO concentration using low-cost light-emitting diodes. To demonstrate the general utility of the platform for both aerobic and anaerobic culture, three bacteria with differential oxygen requirements (E. coli, A. viscosus, and F. nucleatum), as well as a model mammalian cell line (murine embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3)), were cultured.

Here we introduce the Phage On Tap (PoT) protocol for the quick and efficient preparation of homogenous bacteriophage (phage) stocks. This method produces homogenous, laboratory-scale, high titer (up to 1010–11 PFU·ml−1), endotoxin reduced phage banks that can be used to eliminate the variability between phage propagations and improve the molecular characterizations of phage. The method consists of five major parts, including phage propagation, phage clean up by 0.22 μm filtering and chloroform treatment, phage concentration by ultrafiltration, endotoxin removal, and the preparation and storage of phage banks for continuous laboratory use. From a starting liquid lysate of > 100 mL, the PoT protocol generated a clean, homogenous, laboratory phage bank with a phage recovery efficiency of 85% within just two days. In contrast, the traditional method took upwards of five days to produce a high titer, but lower volume phage stock with a recovery efficiency of only 4%. Phage banks can be further purified for the removal of bacterial endotoxins, reducing endotoxin concentrations by over 3,000-fold while maintaining phage titer. The PoT protocol focused on T-like phages, but is broadly applicable to a variety of phages that can be propagated to sufficient titer, producing homogenous, high titer phage banks that are applicable for molecular and cellular assays.","2016-07-26","2020-03-17 21:32:49","2020-07-16 06:57:24","2020-07-14 20:30:50","","","","4","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","tex.ids: bonillaPhageTapQuick2016 PMCID: PMC4975003 PMID: 27547567","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/XYTS62ZU/Bonilla et al_2016_Phage on tap–a quick and efficient protocol for the preparation of.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/7UQQI94I/Bonilla et al. - 2016 - Phage on tap–a quick and efficient protocol for th.pdf; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4975003/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4975003/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The safety assessment of an antenna is required prior to its radiation interaction with biological tissues. In this work, a specially designed and developed Vivaldi antenna with directivity at 45° for microwave holographic imaging has been presented. A detailed simulation of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and thermal analysis due to the radiation exposure of the designed antenna on self-designed anatomically real breast phantoms is performed in CST environment. SAR values for 3D printed breast phantoms are also calculated experimentally. The quantitative results of SAR reveal the variation of ±10% in between the simulation and experimental results. It has been found that SAR due to the radiation of the designed antenna lies in the permissible limit. The thermal analysis in CST shows the rise of 0.096% in temperature after the exposure of 2 hours. Hence, the antenna can be used in microwave holography for breast cancer detection.","2020","2020-07-14 22:35:37","2020-07-14 22:35:39","2020-07-14 22:35:37","466-473","","1","62","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mop.32037","","/home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/PD36W5VC/Kumari et al_2020_SAR analysis of directive antenna on anatomically real breast phantoms for.pdf; /home/arthurdent/Zotero/storage/8MM2RAWK/mop.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
