Previous works (Liu et al, ) appear to demonstrate that several species of viruses exhibit an anomalous dielectric relaxation time of $> 75 \text{ ps}$, as opposed to $< 20 \text{ ps}$ \footnotemark measured in the structures of human tissue.\\



Other studies (Yang et al, Hung et al, Sun et al) then appear to demonstrate experimentally that - due to this effect and the favorable combination of envelope and genome net charge, envelope and capsid yield stress, mass distribution, and overall stiffness - certain viruses can  apparently be made to ring up, leading their envelope to shatter, when exposed to intense but ostensibly safe CW tones in the X-band - very much like a singer might shatter a wine glass.\\

Such a non-thermal mechanism is quite unprecedented and extremely dubious, oft-posited but never substantiated; so it has taken some convincing that this is not a particularly abstruse artifact, especially when considered in the context of the broader non-thermal effects literature. For instance, the very paper (Edwards) which spurred development of the hydration-layer damping hypothesis used to explain these results, is has been quite\cite{Resonances1987} definitively\cite{Microwave1993a} shown to be an artifact, one which we unfortunately have not excluded in our study.\footnotemark \ In fact, even in light of the fine evidence that the other groups have collected, and the poor-quality data we have collected, we are still not entirely convinced that this effect exists - but perhaps this skepticism is unjustified.\\

\footnotetext{we should verify, based on simple solvated sphere damping, whether the damping is of the right order of magnitude}

We contribute almost nothing to the record (much of our discussion has already been covered by []), except by apparently replicating the effect in a T4 bacteriophage surrogate, using both microwave feedback and a luminometric beta-galactosidase infectivity assay. We appear to demonstrate that inactivation does not require 15 minutes, but is complete in less than 500 nanoseconds. This provides a headroom of some $10^6$ to all safety limits imposed by all known harm mechanisms, which can be traded for depth in tissue or distance in space. \\

This technique appears to be unique in that it is selective, save for Far UV or cold-plasma sterilization. Its advantages over those is that it operates over large volumes with inexpensive emitters, but, most critically, can be made to penetrate tissue without harm.

We briefly review the biological basis for the safety. There is solid in vitro and limited in vivo evidence of safety in this regime.

\footnotetext{This value for human structures is the aggregate Cole-Cole relaxation time from Gabriel, in the case of breast tissue (which has the highest value). This is somewhat an unfair comparison; the relaxation time of a heterogeneous mixture such as tissue often appears smaller than that of a pure sample. However, this value agrees well with the individual findings of cellular modes (for instance, the damping from Adair's estimates is approx. 10 ps)}

We briefly examine three applications. All depend significantly on what the microwave spectrum of SARS-NCoV-2 ends up being, which must be measured - or possibly reconstructed from existing whole-virion data or determined from coarse-grained MD simulation. 

With refinements, our inexpensive pulsed microwave spectrometer can obtain the required absorption and threshold data with sufficiently concentrated specimens; but proper dielectric spectroscopy labs (or, in a pinch, swept-EPR/ESR equipment \st{when used improperly}) will provide a much more detailed spectrum. A slightly safer low-titer primary specimen may be usable to avoid BSL-3 requirements. \\



First, free-space techniques are easily implemented to prevent respiratory transmission. A \$10 emitter appears to suffice on a personal level, and \$100 systems for room-scale.\\

Second, via cursory FDTD simulations, using off-the-shelf equipment and modified non-invasive microwave diathermy techniques, it appears to be possible to inactivate all virions in the outer 2 cm of the lungs and inner 1 cm of the bronchi without any effect on the surrounding tissue. 
\\

[] notes that with a bit more effort, by harnessing the dispersive nature of tissue using modulated Brillouin precursors, it may be possible to remove the virus from the body altogether.\\

The mechanism also provides a few distinctive microwave signatures that may be useful for detection; it remains to be seen whether these can be discerned in practice.

The claims above are extraordinary. We do not provide the extraordinary quality of evidence required to support them. Consider: is it more likely that an undergraduate in his parent's basement, with no experience in biology or microwave design, has misinterpreted a blip from a cobbled-together machine, or that

Not to be confused with pseudoscientific 'resonance therapies', nor reports of a connection with 5G communications.

This means that the technique is {\it selective}.
