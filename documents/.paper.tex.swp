The chain of literature 
%
[Fr\"{o}hlich 1968] \textrightarrow \ [Fr\"{o}hlich 1980] \textrightarrow \ [Liu 2009] \textrightarrow \ ([Hung 2014] $\parallel$ [Yang 2015] $\parallel$ [Sun 2017])\footnote{We have not conducted a thorough review; many more papers are probably involved.} apparently culminates in the flagship work we focus on in this paper,

{\it Efficient Structure Resonance Energy Transfer from Microwaves to Confined Acoustic Vibrations in Viruses} [Yang 2015].
%

estabilishes that - unique to certain viruses, and apparently unlike human cellular structures, as we shall see - coincidentally have just the right size, shape, stiffness, and net charge distribution to form a weak (Q=2) spherical dipole resonance mode which couples well to the microwave spectrum at approximately the X-Band, around 7-10 GHz.

More critically, [Yang 2015] (and, in parallel, [Hung 2014]) theoretically model and then experimentally validate in various strains of Influenza A that - due to this acoustic-resonance effect - the power levels required to crack the lipid envelope are on the order of magnitude of the safety limits even for continous point-blank exposure.\footnote{See supplemental.}

They demonstrate this with both a plaque and PCR assay, finding good agreement with the theoretical model.\footnote{As we will discuss, there are a few issues with the experimental technique.; sham, blinding, and dosimetry demanded by [Vjl.] are not mentioned.}

Like pumping a swing, this effect allows an otherwise inconsequential field magnitude to store energy over a small number of cycles until the virus is destroyed. 

\lettrine{It} cannot be overstated how unexpected and dubious this finding appears to be -at least, based on our limited research and experience to date.

For even the RF power limits set by standards organizations appear to be based on the observation that few significant resonance modes exist in biological tissues, and (as we shall see), this is grounded in solid {\it in vitro} (albeit limited {\it in vivo}) evidence. 

This may account for why this paper has been ignored.

It is difficult to reconcile this discrepancy. A failure tree is included below.


If this mechanism exists, it would seem to provide the following advantages over other methods such as UV or cold-plasma sterilization:

\begin{itemize}
  \item This is a non-ionizing, non-thermal
%
\footnote{It may be useful to define 'non-thermal'; it caused us some confusion. Certainly the proteins of the virion locally absorb energy and increase in temperature. The key is that, when excited in this manner, the energies in the envelope are poorly modelled by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution; they are not given sufficient time to 'thermalize'. In contrast, with typical 2.4 GHz microwave exposure, sterilization can only occur by aggregate heating of the fluid and tissue.}
%
, non-chemical technique, harmless for continuous exposure to tissue, which produces no ozone, can be effective inside bodily tissues, and can readily be produced with \$1 - scale devices.
  
  \item Potentially far-field and moderately penetrating inactivation. 
  \item 
  
\end{itemize}





\footnote{It should be noted that this {\it confined} acoustic resonance is subtly distinct from common-and-garden pipe-organ acoustic resonance; this is apparently not a strictly classical phenomenon. Besides standard Coulomb-like and Lennard-Jones-like interactions between constituent particles, if Fr\"{o}hlich is to be believed at these nanoscopic scales there are also wave-function interactions among the particles of the virus which can shift storage to modes not otherwise expected.

We confess to not yet understanding this phenomenon; fortunately, while helpful, the details of how this mode appears are not critical to implementing this technique.}


\footnote{``{[B]elow about 6 GHz, where EMFs penetrate deep into tissue (and thus require depth to be considered), it is useful to describe this in terms of “specific energy absorption rate” (SAR), which is the power absorbed per unit mass $(W/kg)$. Conversely, above 6 GHz, where EMFs are absorbed more superficially (making depth less relevant), it is useful to describe exposure in terms of the density of absorbed power over area $W/m^2$, which we refer to as “absorbed power density”}'' [ICNIRP 2020 \faExternalLink] }

[IEEE C95.1-2005], Annex B, "Identification of levels of RF exposure responsible for adverse
effects: summary of the literature",

\begin{quote}
Further examination of the RF literature reveals no reproducible low level (non-thermal) effect that would
occur even under extreme environmental exposures. The scientific consensus is that there are no accepted
theoretical mechanisms that would suggest the existence of such effects. This consensus further supports the
analysis presented in this section, i.e., that harmful effects are and will be due to excessive absorption of
energy, resulting in heating that can result in a detrimentally elevated temperature. The accepted mechanism
is RF energy absorbed by the biological system through interaction with polar molecules (dielectric relaxation) or interactions with ions (ohmic loss) is rapidly dispersed to all modes of the system leading to an
average energy rise or temperature elevation. Since publication of ANSI C95.1-1982 [B6], significant
advances have been made in our knowledge of the biological effects of exposure to RF energy. This
increased knowledge strengthens the basis for and confidence in the statement that the MPEs and BRs in this
standard are protective against established adverse health effects with a large margin of safety.

The human body contains proteins with all sorts of net charges. 

Other physiological effects include changes in the permeability of membranes, direct nerve stimulation, and others. These are all accounted for in the time-domain equation and the 6-minute averaging period.

This would seem to open an obvious route of optimization. If the virus is destroyed in tens of nanoseconds - essentially governed by instantaneous power. But tissue damage requires *energy deposition*. 

Obviously, the solution is thus to turn the CW microwave signal into an effectively instantaneous pulse.

{\Large \it Talkin' 'bout the Variation}\\

To re-cap, [Yang 2015] theoretically model the virus to determine the minimum electric field required to destroy it. 

They assume that the virus is a simple damped harmonic oscillator, where the 'core' and 'shell' oscillate in opposition. 

They determine the net charge experimentally from microwave absorption measurements.

Since [Yang] try to compute the {\it threshold}, they use a value of 400 pN for the breaking strength of the envelope, obtained from [Li 2011]. However,

Of course, this application is hardly much better than an N95 mask, except that it is non-disposable and provides protection for eyes and skin.

\paragraph{\textbf{Time dependence}}\

The fact that the viral inactivation is non-thermal

Both [Yang 2015] and [Hung 2014] use an apparently arbitrary 15-minute exposure in their tests - a very reasonable decision, given the focus of their paper. 

The effectiveness against airborne particles, and to minimize the power required in a dwelling phased-array beam, we must establish the required duration of exposure.

{\color{red} speculative hypothesizing \{ } 

In contrast to chemical inactivation, where the time dependence appears to be dominated by viscous fluid dynamic effects [Hirose 2017], or UV inactivation, where a certain quantized dose of photons must be absorbed, we expected RF to act instantaneously.

As a damped, driven oscillator, the ring-up time of the virus depends on the Q factor. Yang et al. state the Q of Inf. A as between 2 and 10, so at 8 GHz the steady-state amplitude should be reached in well under 100 nanoseconds.???????????FIXME

[] found a significant mechanical fatigue effect in phage capsids, where a small strain applied repetitively eventually causes a fracture. Such a mechanism could perhaps extend the exposure required to break the capsid or membrane. Other mechanisms could include some sort of lipid denaturation, requiring an absolute amount of energy absorption to break or twist bonds and modify the properties before the envelope fractures.

\paragraph{\textbf{Centrifugal microfluidics}}\

The field of centrifugal microfluidics is accelerating. 

Many CD microfluidics systems use standard CD molding techniques for the channels and machining techniques, using either acrylic or silicone. The turbidity sensor is most sensitive if the plastic is clear. Sterilization does not seem to be discussed. 

Polypropylene is the ideal material, being almost indefinitely autoclavable. It is quite difficult to machine.

\paragraph{\textbf{Personal 'electromagnetic mask'}}\

Even with judicious use of phased-arrays, spatial power-combining, etc, each transistor can only reasonably maintain sterility in approx. $ 0.1 \text{ m}^3 $.

We therefore demonstrate this form factor because, superficially, there are fewer people than there are places. 

On the other hand, a personal device may present issues with participation and production volume. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Direct treatments}}\

[Hand 1982] $E_{mag}=1/e$ (13.5\% power density) skin\footnote{electromagnetic skin, not tissue skin}\footnote{well, both, I suppose.} depth is approximately:

SARS is found widely distributed throughout the most favorable organs [Ding 2004], shielded by an average of 4 cm of chest wall [Schroeder 2013]; so safe external treatment of the body is unlikely.

However, destruction of lung tissue appears to be the primary cause of death via SARS [Nicholls 2006]. 

A bronchoscopic technique may therefore be effective, very similarly to that demonstrated by [Yuan 2019]: in adults, the bronchi are less than 2 mm thick [Theriault 2018] and the lungs themselves are only on the order of 7 mm thick [Chekan 2016]. 

The main bronchus is about 8 mm in diameter, which is smaller than the patch antenna used here; a monopole (or multiple, phased monopoles) like is probably more suitable.


\paragraph{\textbf{More fanciful concepts}}\

Many systems operate in these X-band frequency ranges; and precision 

It is easy to produce megawatts of power at these frequency ranges using Klystrons. Assuming an appropriate antenna, a single 50MW SLAC XL-class klystron with a PRF of 180 Hz could sanitize almost a square kilometer every second. \footnote{Giving 'asceptic field' new meaning.}

On the other hand, if this is conducted in outdoor free-space, sunlight

Existing marine, weather, and aviation radar systems often use the X-band; depending on the focusing power

\paragraph{Sensing}


Surprisingly, there is little discussion on microwave virus detection, with the notable exception of [Mehrotra 2019]. Such scholarly silence is usually an indicator that a technique is impossible for reasons so obvious they scarcely bear repeating. 

However, [Oberoi 2012] find that they can detect a single E. Coli bacterium in 50 uL of broth via a microwave cavity. This is so unbelievable that we are inclined to look for methodological issues. 

Frequency-domain measurements can be made with incredible precision; and there are many parameters by which virions could be discriminated; ring-up time of the resonance, excitation non-linearity, precise microwave spectroscopy, etc.

\paragraph{}

Finally, there is one concern. It has been shown that virions can effect large-scale changes in the electric charges of their []. 

Use of this technique will provide a selection bias towards immunity to electromagnetic fields, which could perhaps be effected by preferring extreme-sized mutants (shifting the resonance away from the applied field). We do not have the biological knowledge to know if this is plausible; it is simply worth mentioning.

Microwave design has a reputation for being the purview of wizards. Modern RF software packages like HFSS, Microwave Office, Agilent's ADS, and Mathworks' RF toolbox, for which; component models 

Luckily, this project falls perfectly within the subset of microwave technologies that do not require a goatee. The vast majority of the behavior of most circuits can be modelled with the very same SPICE tools as one would use at low frequencies. With judicious application of reference designs, it seems to be possible to design 

Before about 2005, however, it seems to have been somewhat the norm to write a simple numerical code to solve the problem at hand based on underlying principles.

We are also aided by the fact that what took a \$150,000 computing cluster a single decade ago can now be done in a few minutes by a single budget GPU.
