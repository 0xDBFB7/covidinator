This work was prepared by an undergraduate and has not been peer-reviewed. 

Additionally, the author has no prior experience with either biology or microwave design. 

Testing was only performed with a surrogate bacteriophage. All experiments must be repeated with Inf. A and then SARS-NCoV-2.

Please consider all claims with appropriate skepticism.

We extend this landmark work rather trivially by:


Aims:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Establishing the time dependence of inactivation
  \item Demonstrating a modulation scheme that decreases the inactivation threshold to below current safety levels in surrogate bacteriophage
  \item Demonstrating a prototype emitter in an "electromagnetic mask" form-factor, costing about \$5 in prototype quantities, which can reasonably be produced in 10 million-of quantities
  \item Testing power thresholds in various conditions; biological fluids of various conductivities and pHs
  \item Using a coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulation to optimize the impulse
  \item Using a virus-in-the-loop optimization with a centrifugal microfluidic system
  \item Discussing the biological basis for the safety of the device
  \item Showing that the deviation from the expected theshold could be explained by variance in the 
\end{itemize}

With typical 2.4 GHz microwave exposure, sterilization occurs by heating of the fluid and tissue.

Of course, the temperature of the atoms of the virus undoubtedly increase; but the

\paragraph{\textbf{Time dependence}}\


Both Yang and [] used an apparently arbitrary 15-minute exposure in their tests - a very reasonable decision given the focus of their paper. 

To determine the effectiveness against airborne particles, and to minimize the power required in a dwelling phased-array beam, we must first establish the required duration of exposure.

{\color{red} speculative hypothesizing \{ } 

In contrast to chemical inactivation, where the time dependence appears to be dominated by viscous fluid dynamic effects [Hirose 2017], or UV inactivation, where a certain dose of photons must be absorbed, one might expect RF 

As a damped, driven oscillator, the ring-up time of the virus depends on the Q factor. Yang et al. state the Q of Inf. A as between 2 and 10, so at 8 GHz the steady-state amplitude should be reached in well under 1 us. 

[] found a significant mechanical fatigue effect in phage capsids, where a small strain applied repetitively eventually causes a fracture. Such a mechanism could perhaps extend the exposure required to break the capsid or membrane. Other mechanisms could include some sort of lipid denaturation, requiring an absolute amount of energy absorption to break or twist bonds before the envelope fractures.

\paragraph{\textbf{The feedback loop oscillator}}\

Oscillators must meet the Barkhausen criterion:

\begin{itemize}

\item A 360 degree phase shift around the feedback loop (including the phase shift contribution from the amplifier, which itself varies greatly with frequency)
\item A loop gain $>1.$ 

\end{itemize}\

However, a third element is also required:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A frequency-selective element that restricts oscillation modes and decreases phase noise.

Without this element, proximity effects from nearby flesh, startup instablity, mode-hopping, and de-tuning were all encountered.

\paragraph{Biasing}\

In our simulations, the varactor-tuned feedback circuit appeared to be particularly sensitive to the introduction of bias-tees. 


The gate must be weakly pulled to ground, otherwise stray charge destroys the oscillation.

With 0.79 mm FR4 substrate and 0.2 mm (8 mil) wide traces, the maximum impedance achievable was about 115 ohms, which did not appear to be sufficient as an RF choke.

If suitably high-impedance traces are not available, a common technique is to use a quarter-wavelength line (approximately 6 mm long with the above parameters) terminated with a stub to produce a virtual short or open circuit [Seo 2007]. 

However, reflections from these structures still appeared to distort the frequency/phase response beyond repair, even with ostensibly wideband stubs [Syrett 1980].

In production, these could be accomodated by graphite-polymer printed resistors. 


Odd-pole varactor-loaded combline filters appeared to have excellent phase and frequency response; however, the geometry necessitates low-inductance via stitching to the ground plane.

[Tsuru 2008 fig. 10] is an excellent review of various oscillator designs.

The parasitic inductance of common varactors appears to become problematic at these frequencies (but not for non-wideband use).

\paragraph{Acknowledgements}\

This paper is not novel enough to deserve this chapter, but those to be acknowledged are.

Professor Shahramian's excellent video blog {\it The Signal Path} inspired this work.

Hopfstader be damned; despite the name below the abstract, this paper is of course entirely the result of circumstance and luck. Any comparable dimwit to the author would have accomplished the same under the same conditions. 

It is infinitely to be regretted that such equally capable people were stuck in warehouses doing menial 15-hour shifts or assembling smartphones.

Chiefly among the enablers are of course my parents, without which the author would not have existed[] - but who also supported this work financially. 



One Very Important Thought


{\Large Captain's Log, Supplemental}

\paragraph{Timeline}

\paragraph{Comments by others}

\paragraph{Lessons Learned}

It may be helpful to treat simulations very similarly to IRL experiments. 

When iteratively testing with simulations, it may be helpful to automatically save a package with images of all the components (schematics, graphs) of each distinct test. Including a picture with a webcam of the assembled board is also helpful. 

Version control alone isn't quite enough. Just having a simulation setup file somewhere in the commit history isn't "discoverable" - that is, you should be able to see what the input and output was without re-running the simulation; and manually taking notes tended to disrupt the flow of testing.



Write a paper to be understood; to be as clear and helpful as possible to the reader.
