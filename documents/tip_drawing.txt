Needed some smaller pipette tips, stat.

Run a small-diameter copper wire through the tubing. 

Clamp 3 mm or so of the pointy end of the tip in a jacobs chuck. 

Point a heat gun at 110c at the tip. Spin the chuck and tip with your fingers. Pull.

Snip, perhaps with a razor blade. Inspect for pock mark holes.

SCratch that. Spinning the tip in a lathe and slowly pressing it into a 0.5 mm die with
a conical entrance made with a V-bit cutter works great.

Still some variation in the tips though, which I'd like to avoid.

McMaster-carr 30-ga ptfe needles came in. Tried devising some way of converting tip-cone to 
luer lock, using various hoses, O rings, etc, nothing worked.

However, cutting the PTFE capillary, snipping 2 mm off a standard pipette tip, and then heating
with 180c air until a blob of polyprop. forms, works great!
breaks as soon as it's autoclaved, however. The old tips work best.
