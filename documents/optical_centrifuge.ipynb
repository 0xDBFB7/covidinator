    "Next we need to know how much energy is lost to friction.

This allows us to extract the friction coefficient from the vibrational Q factor obtained by [Yang 2015]. \n",

Unlike in translational vibration, where the solvent must be inertially displaced, according to [Steele 1963], in the molecular regime a perfect sphere can theoretically undergo perfect slip with the surrounding solvent; friction can only be introduced if there is a change in potential energy between different positions, and a uniform sphere has equal potential energy in every position.\n",
