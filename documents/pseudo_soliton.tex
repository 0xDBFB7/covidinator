Precursor waves do not appear to be explicitly mentioned in IEEE standards, but are implicitly governed by the Fourier-spectrum clauses and more recent FCC ultrawideband regulations. Ultra-short wavepackets of a similar nature are widely used in MRI systems with a repetition rate up to 300 MHz. We can make some mechanistic claims.
