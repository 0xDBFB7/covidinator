Precursor waves do not appear to be explicitly mentioned in IEEE standards, but are implicitly governed by the Fourier-spectrum clauses and more recent FCC ultrawideband regulations. Ultra-short wavepackets of a similar nature are widely used in MRI systems with a repetition rate up to 300 MHz. We can make some mechanistic claims.

There are some extremely tricky subtleties in the simulation.  \cite{propagation1992}. In \cite{Comments1993}, Leubbers says FDTD and FFT both are better than Asympt, Ogh says no there's no problem, Asymptotic is really accurate. Frankly, I can't make heads or tails of any of these, not understanding the asymptotic method at all.

The 2018 NATO Research Task Group 189 report \cite{treatyelectromagnetic} is an excellent source of data for these.

\footnotetext{Honestly, how cool is this? Like, this unimportant factor (as simple as the rise time!) connects so deeply with Schrodinger's wave-packets - the very same functions that apply for probability distributions - and produces a result so striking - a complete change }



The "asymptotic method", and the fourier series method. Unfortunately, the fourier coefficients and phases provide little intuitive sense for how different input pulses propagate.
