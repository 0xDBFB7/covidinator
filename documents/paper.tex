The chain of literature

{\it Efficient Structure Resonance Energy Transfer from Microwaves to Confined Acoustic Vibrations in Viruses} \cite{Efficient2015}.
%

which establishes that - unique to certain viruses, and apparently unlike human cellular structures, as we shall see - coincidentally have just the right size, shape, stiffness, and net charge distribution to form a weak (Q=2) spherical dipole resonance mode which couples well to the microwave spectrum at approximately 8 GHz.

More critically, [] (and, in parallel, [Hung 2014]) theoretically model and then experimentally validate in various strains of Influenza A that - due to this acoustic-resonance effect - the power density levels required to crack the lipid envelope are near the safety limits for continuous exposure to humans.\footnote{Sort of. See below and supplemental.}

They demonstrate this with both a plaque and PCR assay, finding good agreement with the theoretical model.\footnote{As we will discuss, there are a few issues with the experimental technique.; sham, blinding, and dosimetry demanded by [Vjl.] are not mentioned.}

Like pumping a swing, this effect allows an otherwise inconsequential field magnitude to store energy over a small number of cycles until the virus is destroyed. \\

\paragraph{Ramifications}\

If this mechanism exists, it would seem to provide significant advantages over existing UV or cold-plasma sterilization. 

If the extensions made in our paper are valid, this is a non-ionizing, non-thermal
%
\footnote{It may be useful to define 'non-thermal'; it caused us some confusion. Certainly the proteins of the virion locally absorb energy and increase in temperature. The key is that, when excited in this manner, the energies in the envelope are poorly modelled by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution; they are not given sufficient time to 'thermalize'. In contrast, with typical 2.4 GHz microwave exposure, sterilization can only occur by aggregate heating of the fluid and tissue.}

, non-chemical technique, harmless for continuous exposure to tissue, which can sterilize air and surfaces alike, including skin, eyes, and within hair; it evolves no ozone, can readily be generated with \$1 USD - scale devices, acts instantaneously, and - perhaps most critically - could be made to act {\bf within infected tissues}.

The X-band is also minimally absorbed by air, allowing action in the far-field and scaling to square-kilometer areas with single installations.

\begin{autem}

{\it autem}\\
The previous paragraph may cut an impressive figure; but it hinges on all the rest of this paper being correct.

\end{autem}

\lettrine{It} cannot be overstated how unexpected and positively dubious this finding appears to be - that is, based on our limited research and inexperience to date.

For even the RF power limits set by standards organizations like \cite{ICNIRP2020} \cite{IEEE2006} appear to be based on the observation that no significant resonance modes exist in biological tissues due to damping forces from the surrounding tissue \cite{Vibrational2002}. As we shall see, this is grounded in solid {\it in vitro} (albeit more limited {\it in vivo}) evidence. 

This may account for why this paper has been largely ignored.

The precise structure and charge of the virion appears to be a singular anomaly in this otherwise categorical non-existence.


\footnote{It should be noted that this {\it confined} acoustic resonance is subtly distinct from common-and-garden pipe-organ acoustic resonance; this is apparently not a strictly classical phenomenon. Besides standard Coulomb-like and Lennard-Jones-like interactions between constituent particles, if Fr\"{o}hlich is to be believed at these nanoscopic scales there are also wave-function interactions among the particles of the virus which can shift storage to modes not otherwise expected.

We confess to not yet understanding this phenomenon; fortunately, while helpful, the details of how this mode appears are not critical to implementing this technique.}

\footnote{``{[B]elow about 6 GHz, where EMFs penetrate deep into tissue (and thus require depth to be considered), it is useful to describe this in terms of “specific energy absorption rate” (SAR), which is the power absorbed per unit mass $(W/kg)$. Conversely, above 6 GHz, where EMFs are absorbed more superficially (making depth less relevant), it is useful to describe exposure in terms of the density of absorbed power over area $W/m^2$, which we refer to as “absorbed power density”}'' [ICNIRP 2020 \faExternalLink] }

A poignant summary of the consensus is found in \cite{IEEE2006}, Annex B, "Identification of levels of RF exposure responsible for adverse effects: summary of the literature".

\begin{quote}
%%%%%%%%%%%
Further examination of the RF literature reveals no reproducible low level (non-thermal) effect that would
occur even under extreme environmental exposures. The scientific consensus is that there are no accepted
theoretical mechanisms that would suggest the existence of such effects. This consensus further supports the
analysis presented in this section, i.e., that harmful effects are and will be due to excessive absorption of
energy, resulting in heating that can result in a detrimentally elevated temperature. The accepted mechanism
is RF energy absorbed by the biological system through interaction with polar molecules (dielectric relaxation) or interactions with ions (ohmic loss) is rapidly dispersed to all modes of the system leading to an
average energy rise or temperature elevation. Since publication of ANSI C95.1-1982 [B6], significant
advances have been made in our knowledge of the biological effects of exposure to RF energy. This
increased knowledge strengthens the basis for and confidence in the statement that the MPEs and BRs in this
standard are protective against established adverse health effects with a large margin of safety.

\end{quote}

Unfortunately, the buried lede is that the power levels shown by [Yang 2015] are about twice the continuous safety levels. 

\paragraph{Time-domain modulation}

However, there is an obvious avenue of optimization. If the virus is destroyed in a few dozen nanoseconds via an electric field amplitude incidentally caused by an instantaneous power $\text{P}$, but tissue damage requires a temperature rise due to an energy deposition $\text{P} \  \text{dt}$, then we should minimize dt.\

We thus turn the CW microwave signal into a series of effectively instantaneous pulses.

Note that contrary to the limits at lower frequencies, neither ICNIRP nor IEEE appear to explicitly specify a maximum electric field; only the maximum power is specified (thereby implicitly restricting the electric field magnitude).

The safety standards of [IEEE] and [ICNIRP] account for such time-domain modulation by specifying both an average power limit over a 6 minute period, and a time-integrated energy deposition limit. All known non-thermal and thermal physiological effects, including changes in the permeability of membranes, direct nerve stimulation, etc, are accounted for by obeying those two limits.

To drive home this point, apparently the best-quality evidence available fulfills sham requirements provide in-vitro. They expose blood lymphocytes to pulse power in precisely the regime required in this work; 8.2 GHz, 8 ns duration and 50 khz repetition rate, a whopping pulse power density of 250,000 $\text{W/m}^2$\footnote{computed from average power / duty cycle} (2500x the time-averaged power density safety limit), average power density 100 $\text{W/m}^2$ (the safety limit), for 2 hours, finding no change in any of the measured quantities. 

Similarly, [Chemeris 2004] use 8.8 GHz, 180 ns pulse width, peak power 65,000 W, repetition rate 50 Hz, exposure duration 40 min, and find genotoxicity purely due to the temperature rise.

So it appears that this is not merely rules-lawyering to exploit a loophole in the regulations; it is a physically-informed effect.

\begin{autem}

These papers (the best quality we are aware of) were extensively cherry-picked from the literature based on the results of a meta-analysis [Vj. 2019], listing the requirements for reliable in-vitro RF experiments.\\

To illustrate how sensitive this research is, [Chemeris 2004] mention:

\begin{quote}

The increase in DNA damage after exposure of cells to HPPP EMF shown in Table 2 was due to the temperature rise in the cell suspension by $3.5\pm0.1^{\circ}  $C. This was confirmed in sham-exposure experiments and experiments with incubation of cells for 40 min under the corresponding temperature conditions."

Applying microwave power to the body is already used extensively in diathermy (the internal heating of tissue for therapeutic effect) and hyperthermy (the overheating or cauterization of tissue for destructive effect). While most diathermy systems use much lower frequencies for deeper penetration, several papers have explored the 10 GHz band. 

Industry Canada limits on the instantaneous electric field anywhere inside the body are $1.35 \times 10^-4$ V/m * Hz ()\cite{RSS1022015}, Table 4), $0.81 \times 10^6$ V / m \@ 6 GHz to $1.2 \times 10^6$ / m \@ 9 GHz

{\Large \it Time-dependence}\\

The fact that the viral inactivation is non-thermal

Both [Yang 2015] and [Hung 2014] use an apparently arbitrary 15-minute exposure in their tests - a very reasonable decision, given the focus of their paper. 

The effectiveness against airborne particles, and to minimize the power required in a dwelling phased-array beam, we must establish the required duration of exposure.

{\color{red} speculative hypothesizing \{ } 

In contrast to chemical inactivation, where the time dependence appears to be dominated by viscous fluid dynamic effects [Hirose 2017], or UV inactivation, where a certain quantized dose of photons must be absorbed, we expected RF to act instantaneously.

As a damped, driven oscillator, the ring-up time of the virus depends on the Q factor. Yang et al. state the Q of Inf. A as between 2 and 10, so at 8 GHz the steady-state amplitude should be reached in well under 100 nanoseconds.???????????FIXME

[] found a significant mechanical fatigue effect in phage capsids, where a small strain applied repetitively eventually causes a fracture. Such a mechanism could perhaps extend the exposure required to break the capsid or membrane. Other mechanisms could include some sort of lipid denaturation, requiring an absolute amount of energy absorption to break or twist bonds and modify properties before the envelope fractures.

{\Large \it The plausibility of low-cost microwave masks}\\

With the most recent few generations of semiconductor processes, producing significant powers in the X-band has become inexpensive. Silicon transistors are limited in their output power and gain; Silicon-on-insulator topologies 

This is perhaps most readily illustrated with the HB100 radar module. This device implements a complete doppler radar with two RF MOSFETS and a dielectric resonator. It operates at 10.6 GHz, yet are produced for under \$3. The PCB is stock FR4.

Our crude experimentation has yielded about 10 mW with a single SiGe:C transistor, the Infineon BFP620 (\$ 0.34 apiece \@ 1000-of.). For the personal microwave sterilizer, given the threshold levels found by Yang, this corresponds to a cost per sterilized cubic centimeter of approx. \cite{BFP620H7764XTSA1}.

\paragraph{Sensing}

Surprisingly, there is little discussion on microwave virus detection, with the notable exception of [Mehrotra 2019]. Such scholarly silence is usually an indicator that a technique is impossible for reasons so obvious they scarcely bear repeating. 

However, [Oberoi 2012] find that - in controlled conditions - they can detect a single E. Coli bacterium in 50 uL of broth via a microwave cavity. 

Of course, discriminating miniscule returns in free-space is not easy; but with precise knowledge of this resonance mode, it may become somewhat easier. Frequency-domain measurements can be made with incredible precision; and there are many parameters by which virions could be discriminated; ring-up time of the resonance, excitation non-linearity, etc.

Luckily, this project falls perfectly within the subset of microwave technologies that do not require a goatee. The vast majority of the behavior of most circuits can be accurately modelled with the very same SPICE tools as one would use at low frequencies. With judicious application of reference designs, it seems to be possible to design 

Before about 2005, however, it seems to have been somewhat the norm to write a simple numerical code to solve the problem at hand based on underlying principles.

We are also aided by the fact that what took a \$150,000 computing cluster a single decade ago can now be done in a few minutes by a single budget GPU.
