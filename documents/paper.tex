\begin{abstract}
We extend this work rather trivially by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Demonstrating a prototype emitter in an "electromagnetic mask" form-factor, costing about \$5 in prototype quantities, which can be produced in 10 million-of quantities using existing PCB infrastructure  
  \item Using a coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulation 
  \item Discussing the biological basis for the safety of the device
  \item We show that some of the variance can be described by variance in the 
\end{itemize}
