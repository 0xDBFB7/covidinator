	abstract = {Respiratory tract infections can be caused by a wide variety of viruses. Airborne transmission via droplets and aerosols enables some of these viruses to spread efficiently among humans, causing outbreaks that are difficult to control. Many outbreaks have been investigated retrospectively to study the possible routes of inter-human virus transmission. The results of these studies are often inconclusive and at the same time data from controlled experiments is sparse. Therefore, fundamental knowledge on transmission routes that could be used to improve intervention strategies is still missing. We here present an overview of the available data from experimental and observational studies on the transmission routes of respiratory viruses between humans, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss how the available knowledge is currently implemented in isolation guidelines in health care settings.},

Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests. Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible. In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses. Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus. By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection. In contrast to in vitro examinations, the results of these tests allow use recommendations of chemical disinfectants for outbreak situations and daily routine disinfection.},

Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces.
Methods: The efﬁcacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/ p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70\% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62\% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71\% ethanol).
Results: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log10 reduction factor of 3.2 for 70\% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62\% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71\% ethanol. For MHV, log10 reduction factors were 3.9 for 70\% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62\% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71\% ethanol.
Conclusion: Only ethanol reduced infectivity of the 2 coronaviruses by .3-log10 after 1 minute. Germicides must be chosen carefully to ensure they are effective against viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.},

Existing disinfection methods such as irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma-ray, UV/photochemicals, microwave absorption, and pharmaceutical antiviral and antibacterial treatments are not selective; as a result, severe side effects may accompany the treatments. On the other hand, the USP laser method has been shown [3, 6, 9] to inactivate undesired microorganisms like viruses and bacteria while leaving desired materials such as mammalian cells and proteins unharmed; i.e., the USP laser technique is capable of selective disinfection and therefore has minimal potential side effects. Table 2 shows experimental results on the selectivity of a near-infrared USP laser on a variety of microorganisms. The intriguing feature worthwhile mentioning is that there exists a therapeutic window in laser power density between 1 GW/cm2 and 10 GW/cm2 which allows the inactivation of a variety of pathogens while leaving mammalian cells unharmed. The existence of this window enables selective inactivation of microorganisms.

It was the intent of this study to determine whether HTST pasteurization conducted in a continuous-flow pasteurizer that simulates commercial operation would enhance FMDV inactivation in milk. Cows were inoculated in the mammary gland with the field strain of FMDV (01/UK). Infected raw whole milk and 2\% milk were then pasteurized using an Arm-field pilot-scale, continuous-flow HTST pasteurizer equipped with a plate-and-frame heat exchanger and a holding tube. The milk samples, containing FMDV at levels of up to 104 plaque-forming units/mL, were pasteurized at temperatures ranging from 72 to 95°C at holding times of either 18.6 or 36s. Pasteurization decreased virus infectivity by 4 log10 to undetectable levels in tissue culture. However, residual infectivity was still detectable for selected pasteurized milk samples, as shown by intramuscular and intradermal inoculation of milk into naïve steers. Although HTST pasteurization did not completely inactivate viral infectivity in whole and 2\% milk, possibly because a fraction of the virus was protected by the milk fat and the casein proteins, it greatly reduced the risk of natural transmission of FMDV by milk.},

Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly.},

The focus of this study was to evaluate the inactivation efficiency (IE) achieved through filtration coupled with microwave irradiation. MS2 aerosolized through a Collison nebulizer was fed into the system and collected onto the filter. For in-flight microwave decontamination, microwave irradiation was applied to an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) filter supported on a SiC disk for three cycles of selected irradiation times per 10 min (i.e., 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min/10 min) at power levels ranging from 125 W to 375 W. The survival fraction (SF) on the substrate and the IE through the entire system were investigated to determine the efficacy of this approach. SF decreased and IE increased as microwave power level was increased (p = 0.02 and p {\textless} 0.01, respectively) or the application time was extended (p = 0.03 and p {\textless} 0.01, respectively). Both measures changed sharply above a threshold temperature of around 90°C and reached 2 logs at 116 and 109°C, respectively. The log SF and IE of –2.59 and 3.62, respectively, were observed when the operating condition of 375 W for 10 min/cycle was used and the SiC disk facilitated microwave absorption. When a quartz frit was used as a support instead of the SiC disk, log inactivation efficiencies of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3 were measured at relative humidities of 30\%, 60\% and 90\%, respectively, under the same irradiation conditions. Relative humidity is a significant parameter from 50–80°C (p = 0.01). The results demonstrate that microwave-assisted filtration systems can be used as an effective means for inactivating viruses.},

However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.},

	abstract = {Human noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks have suggested that vomiting facilitates transmission of human NoV, but there have been no laboratory-based studies characterizing the degree of NoV release during a vomiting event. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that virus aerosolization occurs in a simulated vomiting event, and to estimate the amount of virus that is released in those aerosols. A simulated vomiting device was constructed at one-quarter scale of the human body following similitude principles. Simulated vomitus matrices at low (6.24 mPa*s) and high (177.5 mPa*s) viscosities were inoculated with low (108 PFU/mL) and high (1010 PFU/mL) concentrations of bacteriophage MS2 and placed in the artificial “stomach” of the device, which was then subjected to scaled physiologically relevant pressures associated with vomiting. Bio aerosols were captured using an SKC Biosampler. In low viscosity artificial vomitus, there were notable differences between recovered aerosolized MS2 as a function of pressure (i.e., greater aerosolization with increased pressure), although this was not always statistically significant. This relationship disappeared when using high viscosity simulated vomitus. The amount of MS2 aerosolized as a percent of total virus “vomited” ranged from 7.2 x 10-5 to 2.67 x 10-2 (which corresponded to a range of 36 to 13,350 PFU total). To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and measure aerosolization of a NoV surrogate in a similitude-based physical model. This has implications for better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection control measures.},

While phages are commonly isolated first and subsequently characterized, it is possible to alter isolation procedures to bias the isolation toward phages with desirable characteristics. Some of these variations are regularly used by some groups while others have only been shown in a few publications. In this review I will describe (1) isolation procedures and variations that are designed to isolate phages with broader host ranges, (2) characterization procedures used to show that a phage may have utility in phage therapy, including some of the limits of such characterization, and (3) results of a survey and discussion with phage researchers in industry and academia on the practice of characterization of phages.},

	abstract = {Safe reuse of wastewater requires high levels of pathogen inactivation. Ozone is a very effective disinfectant for viruses and has distinct benefits over other forms of disinfectants, in that it increases the clarity of water and can oxidize some chemical contaminants in water. However, because of the combination of high ozone demand of most wastewaters and rapid reaction with viruses, determination of ozone dose in wastewater and recycled water treatment is not well defined. While various surrogates are used as indicator organisms for human pathogenic viruses in water reuse practice, much less is known about the relationship between surrogates and human pathogenic viruses for ozone disinfection in wastewater. In this study, the ozone inactivation dose response of several surrogates (Escherichia coli, coliphage T1, T4, PRD-1, ΦX174, and MS2) and human pathogenic viruses (poliovirus 1, echovirus 11, coxsackievirus B5, and adenovirus 2) were compared for the first time in secondary effluent wastewater. A unique reduction equivalent dose method was proposed to compare the inactivation of the microorganisms studied across waters with varying ozone demand. Inactivation of all viruses and surrogates studied was greater than 4 log at ozone Ct levels of less than 1 (mg/L)-min. E. coli and PRD-1 were identified as conservative surrogates for indicating inactivation of human pathogenic viruses in ozone disinfection of wastewater, providing a tool for practitioners and regulators to confidently accept ozonation systems for virus inactivation in wastewater reuse.},

We identified only one study documenting surface disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a {\textgreater}6.6 log reduction after 5-minute exposure to 0.5\% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small-scale tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1\% and 0.5\% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by {\textgreater}4.8 log after only 1-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel miniaturized microstrip hairpin resonator and applies it to the design of an X-band oscillator. The measurement of the resonator itself shows that the suggested resonator provides a higher loaded quality factor with reduced circuit area compared to the conventional hairpin resonator. The oscillators are designed to operate at 9.2 GHz using the conventional and novel hairpin resonators, to compare the phase noise performance. The measurement shows an output power of 9.78 dBm and 10.87 dBm, respectively. The phase noise of the oscillator using the novel resonator shows -101.49 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, which is better than that of the conventional resonator by 6.17 dB.},

	abstract = {A low cost microwave oscillator is fabricated using a RF transistor having a half wave length coaxial line as feedback element. The output impedance is matched with lossless microstrip line and the output is taken across 50Ω load followed by a dc block capacitor. The oscillator is designed by measuring Sparameter of the transistor using a fabricated test fixture and VNA. Software is developed to determine circuit components and dimension of microstrip line, taking transistor S parameter, substrate parameter and operating point as input data. The mask required for the etching the circuit is prepared by using photoplotter. The circuit is fabricated on a low cost double sided copper clad epoxy glass PCB substrate. The power output is about 10 mw at 1.6GHz and band width of 70MHz from NEC transistor.},

	abstract = {A 100-transistor MESFET grid oscillator has been fabricated that generates an effective radiated power of 660W at 9.8GHz and has a directivity of 18.0dB. This corresponds to a total radiated power of 10.3 w , or 103mW per device. This is the largest recorded output power for a grid oscillator. The grid drain-source bias voltage is 7.4V and the total drain current for the grid is 6.0A, resulting in an overall dc-to-rf efficiency of 23\%. The pattern of the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio was measured and found to be essentially independent of the radiation angle. The average SSB noise level was -87 dBc/Hz at an offset of 150 kHz from the carrier. An average improvement in the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio of 5 dB was measured for a 100-transistor grid compared to a 16-transistor grid.},

	abstract = {Half a century of research on membrane-containing phages has had a major impact on virology, providing new insights into virus diversity, evolution and ecological importance. The recent revolutionary technical advances in imaging, sequencing and lipid analysis have significantly boosted the depth and volume of knowledge on these viruses. This has resulted in new concepts of virus assembly, understanding of virion stability and dynamics, and the description of novel processes for viral genome packaging and membrane-driven genome delivery to the host. The detailed analyses of such processes have given novel insights into DNA transport across the protein-rich lipid bilayer and the transformation of spherical membrane structures into tubular nanotubes, resulting in the description of unexpectedly dynamic functions of the membrane structures. Membrane-containing phages have provided a framework for understanding virus evolution. The original observation on membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD1 and human pathogenic adenovirus has been fundamental in delineating the concept of “viral lineages”, postulating that the fold of the major capsid protein can be used as an evolutionary fingerprint to trace long-distance evolutionary relationships that are unrecognizable from the primary sequences. This has brought the early evolutionary paths of certain eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal viruses together, and potentially enables the reorganization of the nearly immeasurable virus population ({\textasciitilde}1 × 1031) on Earth into a reasonably low number of groups representing different architectural principles. In addition, the research on membrane-containing phages can support the development of novel tools and strategies for human therapy and crop protection.},
