  abstract = {An array of three microstrip patch antennas, each connected by a matching network to an IMPATT diode, has been investigated. Coherent radiation from the array was obtained at 10.23 GHz by feeding only the center element with an injectionlocking signal, which then appeared at the input to the other two elements by free space mutual coupling. The three IMPATTs injection locked successfully in this manner. A beamwidth of 38 degrees and sidelobe level of -10 dB were achieved, values consistent with the theory for coherent radiation from an array of this configuration. An RF efficiency of 90\% and a bandwidth of 30 MHz were measured.},

  abstract = {Human noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks have suggested that vomiting facilitates transmission of human NoV, but there have been no laboratory-based studies characterizing the degree of NoV release during a vomiting event. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that virus aerosolization occurs in a simulated vomiting event, and to estimate the amount of virus that is released in those aerosols. A simulated vomiting device was constructed at one-quarter scale of the human body following similitude principles. Simulated vomitus matrices at low (6.24 mPa*s) and high (177.5 mPa*s) viscosities were inoculated with low (108 PFU/mL) and high (1010 PFU/mL) concentrations of bacteriophage MS2 and placed in the artificial “stomach” of the device, which was then subjected to scaled physiologically relevant pressures associated with vomiting. Bio aerosols were captured using an SKC Biosampler. In low viscosity artificial vomitus, there were notable differences between recovered aerosolized MS2 as a function of pressure (i.e., greater aerosolization with increased pressure), although this was not always statistically significant. This relationship disappeared when using high viscosity simulated vomitus. The amount of MS2 aerosolized as a percent of total virus “vomited” ranged from 7.2 x 10-5 to 2.67 x 10-2 (which corresponded to a range of 36 to 13,350 PFU total). To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and measure aerosolization of a NoV surrogate in a similitude-based physical model. This has implications for better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection control measures.},

We compare the crystallographic structures of the capsids with unresolved N‐termini and without them in realistic conditions (room temperature and aqueous solution) and show that the structure is preserved. We find that the chloride ions play a key role in the stability of the capsid. A low number of chloride ions results in loss of the native icosahedral symmetry, while an optimal number of chloride ions create a neutralizing layer next to the positively charged inner surface of the capsid. Understanding the dependence of the capsid stability on the distribution of the ions will help clarify the details of the viral life cycle that is ultimately connected to the role of packaged viral genome inside the capsid.},

The elemental current moments of array are assumed with a transient impulse input for the excitations whose signals are delayed to radiate near-zone focused fields. The transient field phenomena for each of the Floquet mode expansion were analyzed. The solution reduces to the case of far-zone field radiation by moving the focus point to the far zone. The analysis shows that the radiation exhibits an impulse field at the focused point, and finite pulses at locations away from the focus point. Phenomena of partial cylindrical wave functions have been observed.},

Theoretical and clinical models of bronchial morphometry have so far focused on bronchial lumen diameter, and bronchial length and angles, mainly assessed from bronchial casts. However, these models do not provide information on bronchial wall thickness. This paper reports in vivo values of cross-sectional wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter in ten healthy subjects as assessed by multi-detector computed tomography. A validated dedicated software package was used to measure these morphometric parameters up to the 14th bronchial generation, with respect to Weibel's model of bronchial morphometry, and up to the 12th according to Boyden's classification. Measured lumen diameters and homothety ratios were compared with theoretical values obtained from previously published studies, and no difference was found when considering dichotomic division of the bronchial tree. Mean wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter were then provided according to bronchial generation order, and mean homothety ratios were computed for wall area, lumen area and wall thickness as well as equations giving the mean value of each parameter for a given bronchial generation with respect to its value in generation 0 (trachea). Multi-detector computed tomography measurements of bronchial morphometric parameters may help to improve our knowledge of bronchial anatomy in vivo, our understanding of the pathophysiology of bronchial diseases and the evaluation of pharmacological effects on the bronchial wall.},

  abstract = {Laboratory science requires careful maintenance of sterile reagents and tools as well as the sterilization of waste prior to disposal. However, steam autoclaves typically used for this purpose may not be readily accessible to everyone in the scientific community, such as K-12 teachers, researchers in the field, students in under-funded laboratories, or persons in the developing world who lack funding and resources. This work examines the use of commercial electric pressure cookers as an alternative method for the sterilization of media, instruments, and waste. Four commonly available brands of pressure cooker were tested for their ability to sterilize microbiological media, a variety of metal instruments, and high-titer microbial cultures. All four pressure cookers were able to sterilize these starting materials as well as a range of microbial types, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, filamentous fungi, unicellular fungi, and mixed environmental samples. Only the Instant Pot, however, was able to sterilize autoclave tester ampoules of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores. These results suggest that, depending on the nature of the work undertaken, store-bought pressure cookers can be an appropriate substitute for commercial autoclaves. Their adoption may also help increase the accessibility of science to a broader range of investigators.},

  abstract = {Background
Needle thoracostomy is the emergent treatment for tension pneumothorax. This procedure is commonly done using a 4.5cm catheter, and the optimal site for chest wall puncture is controversial. We hypothesize that needle thoracostomy cannot be performed using this catheter length irrespective of the site chosen in either gender.
Methods
A retrospective review of all chest computed tomography (CT) scans obtained on trauma patients from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 was performed. Patients aged 18 and 80 years were included and patients whose chest wall thickness exceeded the boundary of the images acquired were excluded. Chest wall thickness was measured at the 2nd intercostal (ICS), midclavicular line (MCL) and the 5th ICS, anterior axillary line (AAL). Injury severity score (ISS), chest wall thickness, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed.
Results
201 patients were included, 54\% male. Average (SD) BMI was 26 (7)kg/m2. The average chest wall thickness in the overall cohort was 4.08 (1.4)cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 4.55 (1.7)cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. 29\% of the overall cohort (27 male and 32 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 45\% (54 male and 36 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. There was no significant interaction between gender and chest wall thickness at either site. BMI was positively associated with chest wall thickness at both the 2nd and 5th ICS/AAL.
Conclusion
A 4.5cm catheter is inadequate for needle thoracostomy in most patients regardless of puncture site or gender.},

  abstract = {Capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C4D) is an improved approach to avoid the problems of labor-intensive, time-consuming and insufficient accuracy of plate count as well as the high-cost apparatus of flow cytometry (FCM) in bacterial counting. This article describes a novel electrode-integrated printed-circuit-board (PCB)-based C4D device, which supports the simple and safe exchange of capillaries and improves the sensitivity and repeatability of the contactless detection. Furthermore, no syringe pump is needed in the detection, it reduces the system size, and, more importantly, avoids the effect on the bacteria due to high pressure. The recovered bacteria after C4D detection at excitation of 25 Vpp and 60\&ndash;120 kHz were analyzed by flow cytometry, and a survival rate higher than 96\% was given. It was verified that C4D detection did not influence the bacterial viability. Moreover, bacteria concentrations from 106 cells/mL to 108 cells/mL were measured in a linear range, and relative standard deviation (RSD) is below 0.2\%. In addition, the effects on bacteria and C4D from background solutions were discussed. In contrast to common methods used in most laboratories, this method may provide a simple solution to in situ detection of bacterial cultures.},

  abstract = {Mature particles of bacteriophage lambda are composed of about equal amounts of protein and DNA. Each phage contains one double-stranded DNA molecule encapsulated in an icosahedral head, which is about 50 nm (0.05 μ) in diameter; a flexible tubular tail, which is about 150 nm (0.15 μ) long and terminates in a fiber, projects from the head (Kellenberger and Edgar, 1971). Lambda is an obligatory parasite of Escherichia coli. Growth begins when a phage particle attaches to the host by the tip of its tail and injects its DNA molecule. Lambda is a temperate phage and, thus, can multiply in E. coli by one of three ways: (1) In productive growth, the injected DNA molecule directs the synthesis of numerous gene products; these promote replication of the phage DNA, synthesis of the phage heads and tails, packaging of the DNA into mature phage particles, and eventual lysis of the cell. At 37°C it takes about 40 minutes for a lytic cycle, and about 100 infective progeny phage are produced. (2) Lambda DNA can also persist in the host cell as a prophage and replicate passively as an integral part of the bacterial genome. In this case the injected DNA must first direct the synthesis of the gene products that promote its linear insertion into the genome of the host. Next, it turns on the synthesis of the repressor, which blocks transcription of those genes responsible for autonomous lambda DNA replication and most other phage functions.},

We show that empty shells withstand nanonewton forces while being indented up to 30\% of their height. The elastic response varies across the surface, reflecting the arrangement of shell proteins. The measured Young's modulus (≈1.8 GPa) is comparable with that of hard plastic. We also observe fatigue and breakage of capsids after probing them repetitively. These results illustrate the mechanoprotection that viral shells provide and also suggest design principles for nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {Virtually all studies of phage infections investigate bacteria growing exponentially in rich media. In nature, however, phages largely encounter non-growing cells. Bacteria entering stationary phase often activate well-studied stress defense mechanisms that drastically alter the cell, facilitating its long-term survival. An understanding of phage-host interactions in such conditions is of major importance from both an ecological and therapeutic standpoint. Here, we show that bacteriophage T4 can efficiently bind to, infect and kill E. coli in stationary phase, both in the presence and absence of a functional stationary-phase sigma factor, and explore the response of T4-infected stationary phase cells to the addition of fresh nutrients 5 or 24 hours after that infection. An unexpected new mode of response has been identified. “Hibernation” mode is a persistent but reversible dormant state in which the infected cells make at least some phage enzymes, but halt phage development until appropriate nutrients become available before producing phage particles. Our evidence indicates that the block in hibernation mode occurs after the middle-mode stage of phage development; host DNA breakdown and the incorporation of the released nucleotides into phage DNA indicate that the enzymes of the nucleotide synthesizing complex, under middle-mode control, have been made and assembled into a functional state. Once fresh glucose and amino acids become available, the standard lytic infection process rapidly resumes and concentrations of up to 1011 progeny phage (an average of about 40 phage per initially-present cell) are produced. All evidence is consistent with the hibernation-mode control point lying between middle mode and late mode T4 gene expression. We have also observed a “scavenger” response, where the infecting phage takes advantage of whatever few nutrients are available to produce small quantities of progeny within 2 to 5 hours after infection. The scavenger response seems able to produce no more than an average of one phage per originally-available cell, and few if any further progeny are produced by cells in this mode even if fresh nutrients are made available later.},

This required focusing time delay has been modified from the current formulation to incorporate either an odd or even number of elements. A brief procedure leading to the derivation of the pressure distribution for beam focusing is described, which gives rise to an unclosed form. Consequently, a numerical method is desirable for the analysis of beam focusing. Using this approach, beam directivity and pressure distributions are studied to predict the behavior of focusing as compared to steering. This shows a benefit of focusing over steering within the near field of the array, and that the directivity of focusing converges to that of steering in the far field.},

We have applied methods primarily based on atomic force microscopy and finite element modeling that allow precise investigation of the mechanical properties of the influenza virus lipid envelope. The mechanical properties of small, spherical vesicles made from PR8 influenza lipids were probed by an atomic force microscopy tip applying forces up to 0.2 nN, which led to an elastic deformation up to 20\%, on average. The liposome deformation was modeled using finite element methods to extract the lipid bilayer elastic properties. We found that influenza liposomes were softer than what would be expected for a gel phase bilayer and highly deformable: Consistent with previous suggestion that influenza lipids do not undergo a major phase transition, we observe that the stiffness of influenza liposomes increases gradually and weakly (within one order of magnitude) with temperature. Surprisingly, influenza liposomes were, in most cases, able to withstand wall-to-wall deformation, and forces {$>$}1 nN were generally required to puncture the influenza envelope, which is similar to viral protein shells. Hence, the choice of a highly flexible lipid envelope may provide as efficient a protection for a viral genome as a stiff protein shell.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the biological effects of microwaves. It is emphasized that an appropriate discussion of the experimental results with regard to nonthermal effects must frequently consider thermal effects as well. The amount of energy transfer from the radiation to the material varies slowly with frequency and is largely governed by the dielectric loss. Within reasonable limits, this loss is proportional to the intensity of the radiation. Nonthermal effects, on the other hand, occur in certain frequency regions only, and usually exhibit saturation at rather low intensity. As a consequence, nonthermal effects might be drowned by the thermal ones. This is in particular to be expected when the sign of the considered effect in the nonthermal region is opposite to that of the thermal effect. As an example, consider the reduction of the rate of growth of certain bacteria arising from irradiation at 73.6 Hz as discussed. Temperature increase, on the other hand, increases the rate of growth, thus canceling the nonthermal effect at sufficiently high intensity.},

  abstract = {Over the past 50 years, significant advances have been made in the characterization of radio-frequency/microwave (RF/MW) fields (3 kHz–300 GHz) and energy absorption, as well as in the quantification of biological responses of organisms exposed to this kind of electromagnetic energy. The known biological effects and hazards have been demonstrated to be largely thermal in nature. This paper reviews key developments in experimental and theoretical dosimetry, as well as confirmed biological effects that have formed the basis of ever more sophisticated human-exposure standards generated through the IEEE consensus process. It also suggests some potential benefits to mankind of systems based on the thermogenic character of RF/MW energy absorption.},

  abstract = {One of the most popular methods to fabricate biomedical microfluidic devices is by using a soft-lithography technique. However, the fabrication of the moulds to produce microfluidic devices, such as SU-8 moulds, usually requires a cleanroom environment that can be quite costly. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop low-cost alternatives for the fabrication of microstructures, avoiding the use of cleanroom facilities. Recently, low-cost techniques without cleanroom facilities that feature aspect ratios more than 20, for fabricating those SU-8 moulds have been gaining popularity among biomedical research community. In those techniques, Ultraviolet (UV) exposure equipment, commonly used in the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) industry, replaces the more expensive and less available Mask Aligner that has been used in the last 15 years for SU-8 patterning. Alternatively, non-lithographic low-cost techniques, due to their ability for large-scale production, have increased the interest of the industrial and research community to develop simple, rapid and low-cost microfluidic structures. These alternative techniques include Print and Peel methods (PAP), laserjet, solid ink, cutting plotters or micromilling, that use equipment available in almost all laboratories and offices. An example is the xurography technique that uses a cutting plotter machine and adhesive vinyl films to generate the master moulds to fabricate microfluidic channels. In this review, we present a selection of the most recent lithographic and non-lithographic low-cost techniques to fabricate microfluidic structures, focused on the features and limitations of each technique. Only microfabrication methods that do not require the use of cleanrooms are considered. Additionally, potential applications of these microfluidic devices in biomedical engineering are presented with some illustrative examples.},

Automated methods are independent of skill levels and daily constitution of laboratory staff in combination with a constant quality and performance of the methods. The Biomek Cell Workstation was configured as a flexible and compatible system. The modified Biomek Cell Workstation enables the cultivation of adherent and suspension cells. Until now, no commercially available systems enabled the automated handling of both types of cells in one system. In particular, the automated cultivation of suspension cells in this form has not been published. The cell counts and viabilities were nonsignificantly decreased for cells cultivated in AutoFlasks in automated handling. The proliferation of manual and automated bioscreening by the WST-1 assay showed a nonsignificant lower proliferation of automatically disseminated cells associated with a mostly lower standard error. The disseminated suspension cell lines showed different pronounced proliferations in descending order, starting with Jurkat cells followed by SEM, Molt4, and RS4 cells having the lowest proliferation. In this respect, we successfully disseminated and screened suspension cells in an automated way. The automated cultivation and dissemination of a variety of suspension cells can replace the manual method.},

  abstract = {Thermoplastics are highly attractive substrate materials for microfluidic systems, with important benefits in the development of low cost disposable devices for a host of bioanalytical applications. While significant research activity has been directed towards the formation of microfluidic components in a wide range of thermoplastics, sealing of these components is required for the formation of enclosed microchannels and other microfluidic elements, and thus bonding remains a critical step in any thermoplastic microfabrication process. Unlike silicon and glass, the diverse material properties of thermoplastics opens the door to an extensive array of substrate bonding options, together with a set of unique challenges which must be addressed to achieve optimal sealing results. In this paper we review the range of techniques developed for sealing thermoplastic microfluidics and discuss a number of practical issues surrounding these various bonding methods.},

Using a finite integration method (CST Microwave), a parametric investigation was performed for the optimization. To validate our analysis, a prototype of the optimized antenna was fabricated and measured. The predicted results are computed with measured data and good agreement is reported. With the proposed antenna, a fractional bandwidth of 50\% around the center frequency 10 GHz is achieved, and relatively stable radiation patterns are obtained in the matching band.},

We have examined the proteins of a large number of representative eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses for the occurrence of significant clusters, runs, and periodic patterns of charge. Clusters and runs of positive charge are prominent in many capsid and core proteins, whereas surface (glyco)proteins frequently contain a negative charge cluster. Significant charge configurations are abundant in regulatory proteins implicated in transcriptional transactivation and cellular transformation. Proteins with charge structures are much more predominant in animal DNA viruses as compared to animal RNA viruses and prokaryotic viruses. This contrast might reflect the role of protein charge structures in facilitating competitive virus-host interactions involving the cellular transcription, translation, protein sorting, and transport apparatus.},

IDPs play important roles in a range of biological functions, and their dysregulation is central to numerous diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. The conformational ensembles of IDPs are encoded by their amino acid sequences. Here, we present two computational tools that are designed to enable rapid and high-throughput analyses of a wide range of physicochemical properties encoded by IDP sequences. The first, CIDER, is a user-friendly webserver that enables rapid analysis of IDP sequences. The second, localCIDER, is a high-performance software package that enables a wide range of analyses relevant to IDP sequences. In addition to introducing the two packages, we demonstrate the utility of these resources using examples where sequence analysis offers biophysical insights.},

  abstract = {In the coarse grained Brownian Dynamics simulation method the many solvent molecules are replaced by random thermal kicks and an effective friction acting on the particles of interest. For Brownian Dynamics the friction has to be so strong that the particles' velocities are damped much faster than the duration of an integration timestep. Here we show that this conceptual limit can be dropped with an analytic integration of the equations of damped motion. In the resulting Langevin integration scheme our recently proposed approximate form of the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles can be incorparated conveniently, leading to a fast multi-particle propagation scheme, which captures more of the short-time and short-range solvent effects than standard BD. Comparing the dynamics of a bead-spring model of a short peptide, we recommend to run simulations of small biological molecules with the Langevin type finite damping and to include the hydrodynamic interactions.},

  abstract = {[spa] Los virus son entidades biológicas relativamente simples, pero muy eficientes. En su forma más simple están constituidos por una cadena de material genético protegida por una cubierta de proteínas llamada cápside, cuya formación y propiedades juegan un papel crucial en el ciclo vital de los virus. Un mayor conocimiento de la física que se esconde tras los virus permitiría no sólo combatirlos, sino también usarlos para aplicaciones útiles en disciplinas como la medicina, nanociencia o farmacia. En esta tesis nos hemos centrado en la caracterización física de las propiedades mecánicas y el autoensamblaje de la cápsida de virus esféricos con simetría icosaédrica. Para ello hemos propuesto un modelo de grano-grueso basado en un potencial de interacción sencillo entre las subunidades estructurales de la cápsida. Los parámetros del modelo están directamente relacionados con propiedades físicamente relevantes y que pueden ser medibles experimentalmente, como son la curvatura espontánea de la cápside y la constante elástica de flexión. Estos dos ingredientes son cruciales para determinar la arquitectura y el tamaño de los virus. Con este nuevo modelo, hemos hecho simulaciones usando diferentes técnicas para reproducir y estudiar experimentos de auto-ensamblaje. En particular, hemos analizado el rango de parámetros y las condiciones adecuadas que determinan la forma y la estabilidad de las distintas estructuras de los virus. También hemos analizado la cinética de autoensamblaje y los pasos intermedios de la formación de virus, inaccesibles experimentalmente por las características del proceso. Además hemos determinado la importancia de la geometría y más concretamente del número de triangulación y la clase en la respuesta mecánica y en la tendencia a cambiar de forma durante el proceso de maduración. Este cambio de forma conlleva una mayor rigidez y tolerancia a la presión, que puede aportar ventajas biológicas especialmente en virus de ADN de doble cadena. Finalmente, hemos desarrollado modelos de elementos finitos y simulaciones discretas para interpretar experimentos de nanoindentación con AFM. Con ellos hemos estudiado la ruptura y la dureza de la cápside del bacteriófago T7 orientada según los diferentes ejes de simetría icosaédrica, y desarrollado un método para determinar la presión interna en el bacteriófago phi29.},

It explains how this approach can be used in the simulation and modeling of condensed phase and biomolecular systems. Each chapter focuses on specific examples of evolving coarse-graining methodologies and presents results for a variety of complex systems. The contributors carefully detail their own coarse-graining approach, exploring its motivation, strengths, weaknesses, and important application examples. They discuss two of the most successful coarse-graining schemes for soft matter: inverse and multiscale coarse-graining. The book also describes current coarse-grained model development for peptides and proteins at the amino acid level and larger length scales. Assembling the work of some of the most influential, world-renowned researchers in the field, this book provides a unified, in-depth overview of all the coarse-grained schemes developed for condensed phase and biomolecular systems. It shows the promise of coarse-graining as a revolutionary advancement in the scientific community.},

We show surface-induced correlations, excluded volume, and electrostatic forces are sufficient to predict most of the major features of the current structural data for DNA packaged within viral capsids without additional ordering due to elastic bending forces for the polymer. Current models assume highly-ordered, even spooled, hexagonally packed conformations based on interpretation of cryo-EM density maps. We show herein that the surface induced packing of short (6mer), unconnected DNA polymer segments is the only necessary ingredient in creating ringed densities consistent with experimental density maps. This implies the ensemble of possible conformations of polymeric DNA within the capsid that are consistent with cryo-EM data may be much larger than implied by traditional interpretations where such rings can only result from highly-ordered spool-like conformations. This opens the possibility of a more disordered, entropically-driven view of phage packaging thermodynamics. We also show the electrostatics of the DNA contributes a large portion of the internal hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of a phage virion, suggesting that nonlinear elastic anomalies might reduce the overall elastic bending enthalpy of more disordered conformations to have allowable free energies.},

  abstract = {Background
Recently, multi-planar reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) spiral chest CT scan has demonstrated superiority in the evaluation of the tracheobronchial tree. The goal of this study was to measure the lengths of the right and left main bronchi and their anteroposterior (AP) and transverse (TR) diameters using the 3D and two-dimensional (2D) images in the same adult respectively, and to evaluate the degree of correlation between them.

Methods
We measured the lengths of the right and left main bronchi from the carina to the first of their branches and the AP and TR diameters at the mid-portion of the right main bronchus and 2 cm below the carina in the left main bronchus. We determined the size of the left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT) based on the measured AP diameter of the left main bronchus from the 3D and 2D images, respectively.

Results
There was moderate correlation between the lengths of both main bronchi obtained from the 3D images and the 2D images, and between the AP diameter of the left main bronchus obtained from the 3D images and the 2D images. Same sized DLTs were estimated in 69\% of the men and 34\% of the women.

Conclusions
The lengths of the right and left main bronchi and their AP and TR diameters obtained from 3D images were not strongly correlated with those from 2D images. Therefore, a further study is needed to verify the superiority of 3D images in selecting the appropriate size of left-sided DLT.},

  abstract = {In this manuscript, we report on the culture of anaerobic and aerobic species within a disposable multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device with an integrated differential oxygenator. A gas-filled microchannel network functioning as an oxygen−nitrogen mixer generates differential oxygen concentration. By controlling the relative flow rate of the oxygen and nitrogen input gases, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in proximal microchannels filled with culture media are precisely regulated by molecular diffusion. Sensors consisting of an oxygen-sensitive dye embedded in the fluid channels permit dynamic fluorescence-based monitoring of the DO concentration using low-cost light-emitting diodes. To demonstrate the general utility of the platform for both aerobic and anaerobic culture, three bacteria with differential oxygen requirements (E. coli, A. viscosus, and F. nucleatum), as well as a model mammalian cell line (murine embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3)), were cultured. Growth characteristics of the selected species were analyzed as a function of eight discrete DO concentrations, ranging from 0 ppm (anaerobic) to 42 ppm (fully saturated).},

  abstract = {Hybrid male mice were exposed to 2·45 GHz microwaves for 30 min/day, 6 days a week for two consecutive weeks at power densities of 1·0, 100 or 400 W m−2, with sham-exposed controls. Rectal temperatures before and after exposure were measured on days 1, 6 and 12. Measurements made on day 1 were treated with caution because of heterogeneity in rectal temperatures taken before exposure between the groups of mice given different treatments. On days 6 and 12, rectal temperatures rose by approximately 1°C in mice sham exposed, or exposed to 1 W m−2 or 100 W m−2. Only in the group of mice exposed to 400 W m−2 was the mean rise in rectal temperature during exposure (about 3°C) significantly increased above the sham value. In groups killed 2–3 days after treatment (mainly meiotic exposure) frequencies of chromosome aberrations in spermatocytes showed no significant heterogeneity although the highest frequency of 1·5 per cent was at the highest (400 W m−2 power density. Another group killed 30 days after 100 W m−2 exposures (spermatogonial sampling) showed no significant increase over controls in chromosome aberration frequency. There was a small but significant increase in sperm count with increasing power density in mice killed 12–13 days after exposure, but a non-significant one in those exposed as spermatogonia (killed 41 days later). Thus effects were markedly less severe than those reported previously by Manikowska-Czerska et al. (1985) with a very similar radiation regime and were probably caused by the temperature enhancement.},

  abstract = {A cascode bipolar low-noise amplifier (LNA) with capacitive shunt feedback has been developed to present a solution for simultaneous noise and power match when the real part of the optimum source impedance is not 50 Ω in order to keep high current density under power constraint. The proposed LNA also has the capability for the simultaneous improvement of noise figure (NF) and linearity. In addition, we analyzed and verified that the second-order interaction, which affects the third-order nonlinearity, becomes less sensitive to the low-frequency input termination at higher bias currents. The possibility of removing the low-frequency LC trap is investigated based on this analysis. We also show that LNAs with smaller base and/or smaller emitter resistances require lower source impedance at low frequencies to improve linearity by the same amount. Finally, prudent layouts for improving the performance of the LNA are considered. Eleven design examples of the proposed LNA, which individually operate at 880, 1575, or 1960 MHz, are fabricated in a low-cost 0.35- μm SiGe BiCMOS process to verify the design and analysis experimentally. The fabricated LNAs have excellent performances, especially in NF. For example, the 880-MHz LNA has an NF of 0.9 dB, a power gain of 16 dB, and an IIP3 of +14 dBm with current consumption of 11 mA from a 2.8-V power supply.},

Two systems were modelled, a stable capsid with neutralising number of ions and an unstable capsid with low number of ions. For the ion distribution analysis the capsid’s structure was identical and fixed in both simulations. It was then released for the stability analysis. The ion distribution demonstrated two types of the local regions on the inner surface of the capsid’s wall: highly occupied with chloride ions in both systems despite a largely uniform electrostatic potential everywhere on the surface, and the regions that loose almost all chloride ions in the unstable capsid. The latter regions are located close to the cracks that are formed when the capsid is destabilised and thus could initiate the collapse of the capsid.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the subject of RF signal detection from the point of view of those who design and calibrate impedance matching bridges and other measuring instruments operating in the HF and VHF radio ranges. The principal discussion relates to the simple diode peak-detector; and covers the different possible circuit configurations, the associated theory, and the numerical methods needed for data analysis. Circuit techniques used to linearise the diode detector output are to be discussed in a separate document. Analysis of the detector transfer characteristic for sinusoidal input shows that the AC-induced error term involves the zero-order modified Bessel function of the first kind (I0). This result is not new, but it is often disregarded. The dynamic contribution is quite unlike the error that occurs for DC input, regardless of any compensatory modification of circuit parameters; which means that linearity correction schemes using a reference diode to produce a DC amplifier with a complementary gain law can never be perfect. It is also shown however, that the AC error is independent of frequency provided that the smoothing capacitor is 'large'. This means that the tracking detector system, which involves automatic self-calibration against a low-frequency precision rectifier, is theoretically sound. By considering the power dissipated in the detector, it is shown that the input impedance can be calculated using first and zero-order modified Bessel functions of the first kind (I0 and I1). This allows the determination of detector transfer-functions that take source impedance into account. When this facility is combined with the ability to calculate the dynamic component of the peak detection error, a measurement of DC output taken with a calibrated voltmeter can be converted into a measurement of AC input without the need for an AC reference. The computation procedures required are not simple, but they are described in detail and given as Basic algorithms readily adaptable to any programming environment.},

We investigated possible genotoxic effects of HPPP EMF (8.8 GHz, 180 ns pulse width, peak power 65 kW, repetition rate 50 Hz) on erythrocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis. We used the alkaline comet assay, which is a highly sensitive method to assess DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile lesions. Blood samples were exposed to HPPP EMF for 40 min in rectangular wave guide. The specific absorption rate (SAR) calculated from temperature kinetics was about 1.6 kW/kg (peak SAR was about 300 MW/kg). The temperature rise in the blood samples at steady state was 3.5 ± 0.1 ◦C. The data show that the increase in DNA damage after exposure of erythrocytes to HPPP EMF was induced by the rise in temperature in the exposed cell suspension. This was confirmed in experiments in which cells were incubated for 40 min under the corresponding temperature conditions. The results allow us to conclude that HPPP EMF-exposure at the given modality did not cause any a-thermal genotoxic effect on frog erythrocytes in vitro.},

The structure of DNAFETs is similar to that of MOSFETs, with the exception of the gate structure which, in DNAFETs, is replaced by a layer of immobilized ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) molecules which act as surface receptors. When complementary DNA strands hybridize to the receptors, the charge distribution near the surface changes, which in turn modulates current transport through the semiconductor transducer.
Arrays of DNAFETs can be used for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (causing many hereditary diseases) and for DNA sequencing. Their main advantage compared to optical detection methods in common use today is that they do not require labeling of molecules. Furthermore, they work continuously and (near) real-time. DNAFETs are highly selective since only specific binding modulates charge transport.},

DremelFuge is a printable rotor for centrifuging standard microcentrifuge tubes and miniprep columns. Compared to the cost of a new centrifuge (priced by a fellow Thingiversian at \$500 minimum on Froogle), a Dremelfuge is incredibly cheap. It can be used for DIYbio ( http://www.diybio.org ) or for some culinary uses. It requires industry standard 1.5ml/2ml Eppendorf/Microcentrifuge tubes.
Used with a drill at 3000 RPM, the Dremelfuge will deliver over 400g, enough to comfortably spin down Miniprep samples (proven personally). It will likely achieve acceptable results at lower speeds, too.
Used at 10krpm, on a Rotary tool for instance, a Dremelfuge should deliver over 4400g, more than enough to spin down bacterial cells.
At 16krpm, Dremelfuge matches commercial centrifuges.
On a Dremel 300, a maximum speed of 33krpm equates to a force of over 50,000 times earth's gravity, which puts it into so-called "Ultracentrifuge" territory. The latest version (as printed by Shapeways) has successfully spun tubes at this speed.
To see some picures of Dremelfuge used to spin down cells, see here:http://letters.cunningprojects.com/?p=85

Dremelfuge is available for sale as a high-quality, robust print on Shapeways.com in two editions, each suited for up to six samples at a time: Dremelfuge Recessed Edition, to fit the cutting-tool-holder commonly found with rotary tools (5mm diameter bore), and Dremelfuge Chuck Edition, which can be quickly adapted for use in any machine with a chuck grip. They are both available here on my Shapeways shop:http://shapeways.com/shops/labsfromfabs

  abstract = {Background Influenza viruses show a significant capacity to evade host immunity; this is manifest both as large occasional jumps in the antigenic phenotype of viral surface molecules and in gradual antigenic changes leading to annual influenza epidemics in humans. Recent mouse studies show that avidity for host cells can play an important role in polyclonal antibody escape, and further that electrostatic charge of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein can contribute to such avidity. Methodology/Principal Findings We test the role of glycoprotein charge on sequence data from the three major subtypes of influenza A in humans, using a simple method of calculating net glycoprotein charge. Of all subtypes, H3N2 in humans shows a striking pattern of increasing positive charge since its introduction in 1968. Notably, this trend applies to both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins. In the late 1980s hemagglutinin charge reached a plateau, while neuraminidase charge started to decline. We identify key groups of amino acid sites involved in this charge trend. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge these are the first indications that, for human H3N2, net glycoprotein charge covaries strongly with antigenic drift on a global scale. Further work is needed to elucidate how such charge interacts with other immune escape mechanisms, such as glycosylation, and we discuss important questions arising for future study.},

Risk assessment of typical intense pulsed light and laser intensities, spectral characteristics and the subsequent chemical, physiological and psychological effects of such outputs on vital organs as consequence of inappropriate output use are examined. This technical note focuses on wavelength, illumination geometry and skin tone and their effect on the energy density (fluence) distribution within tissue. Monte Carlo modelling is one of the most widely used stochastic methods for the modelling of light transport in turbid biological media such as human skin. Using custom Monte Carlo simulation software of a multi-layered skin model, fluence distributions are produced for various non-ionising radiation combinations. Fluence distributions were analysed using Matlab mathematical software. Penetration depth increases with increasing wavelength with a maximum penetration depth of 5378~μm calculated. The calculations show that a 10-mm beam width produces a fluence level at target depths of 1–3~mm equal to 73–88\% (depending on depth) of the fluence level at the same depths produced by an infinitely wide beam of equal incident fluence. Meaning little additional penetration is achieved with larger spot sizes. Fluence distribution within tissue and thus the treatment efficacy depends upon the illumination geometry and wavelength. To optimise therapeutic techniques, light-tissue interactions must be thoroughly understood and can be greatly supported by the use of mathematical modelling techniques.},

The FDTD algorithm is coupled to a set of equations which describes both linear and non linear lumped elements. The simulation time step is adaptively adjusted by monitorng the convergence of the NewtonRaphson procedure adopted for the non-linear solution. This considerably speeds up the simulation, with respect to the adoption of a worst-case, fixed time step. The propagation of a high speed digital signal along a transmission lines is presented as an example. Simulation results are compared with SPICE outputs, showing excellent agreement.},

However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.},

  abstract = {We report direct, real-time electrical detection of single virus particles with high selectivity by using nanowire field effect transistors. Measurements made with nanowire arrays modified with antibodies for influenza A showed discrete conductance changes characteristic of binding and unbinding in the presence of influenza A but not paramyxovirus or adenovirus. Simultaneous electrical and optical measurements using fluorescently labeled influenza A were used to demonstrate conclusively that the conductance changes correspond to binding/unbinding of single viruses at the surface of nanowire devices. pH-dependent studies further show that the detection mechanism is caused by a field effect, and that the nanowire devices can be used to determine rapidly isoelectric points and variations in receptor-virus binding kinetics for different conditions. Lastly, studies of nanowire devices modified with antibodies specific for either influenza or adenovirus show that multiple viruses can be selectively detected in parallel. The possibility of large-scale integration of these nanowire devices suggests potential for simultaneous detection of a large number of distinct viral threats at the single virus level.},

  abstract = {The standard Finite-difference Time-domain (FDTD) method requires extremely small time-step sizes when modelling scattering objects that are large compared with the wavelength. This is especially so in modelling biological cells having sizes of the order of a few tens of micrometers. This can become impractical due to the unaffordable computation times required. This problem can be overcome by implementing a quasi-static approximate version of FDTD, based on transferring the working frequency to a higher frequency, to reduce the number of time steps required. Then, the generated internal field at the higher frequency can be scaled back to the frequency of interest. This paper presents an approach to modelling and analysis of the HH (Hodgkin and Huxley) membrane model that is represented as an electrical circuit on the surface of a biological equivalent spherical cell. Since the external medium of the biological cell is lossy material, a modified Berenger perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition is used to truncate the computation grid. The total fields of the simulated structures have been shown to give reasonable and stable result at 900 and 1800 MHz.},

Our SVAMs are low loss because they do not contain metals and are extraordinarily broadband, working from DC up to a cutoff. In the present work, a microstrip transmission line was isolated from a metal object placed in close proximity by embedding it in a SVAM so that the field avoided the object. Our paper begins by outlining a simple model for studying transmission lines embedded in SVAMs. We then present our design and experimental results to confirm the concept. 1.},

The smart platform is developed to extend conventional Lab-on-a-Disc applications with an electronic interface, providing additional flow control and sensing capabilities to centrifugal microfluidics platforms. Wireless power is transferred from a Qi-compliant transmitter to the eLoaD platform during rotation. An Arduino-based microcontroller, a Bluetooth communication module, and an on-board SD-card are integrated into the platform. This generalises the applicability of the eLoaD and its modules for performing a wide range of laboratory unit operations, procedures, or diagnostic assays, all controlled wirelessly during spinning. The lightweight platform is fully reusable and modular in design and construction. An interchangeable and non-disposable application disc is fitted with the necessary sensors and/or actuators for a specific assay or experiment to be performed. A particular advantage is the ability to continuously monitor and interact with LoaD experiments, overcoming the limitations of stroboscopy. We demonstrate the applicability of the platform for three sensing experiments involving optical, electrochemical, and temperature detection, and one actuation experiment involving controlled heating/cooling. The complete electronic designs and example programming codes are extensively documented in the supplementary material for easy adaptation.},

Biomatter-wave interaction modalities are considered over a wide range of frequencies and applications such as detection of cancer biomarkers, biotin, neurotransmitters and heart rate are presented in detail. By treating biological tissue as a dielectric substance, having a unique dielectric signature, it can be characterized by frequency dependent parameters such as permittivity and conductivity. By observing the unique permittivity spectrum, cancerous cells can be distinguished from healthy ones or by measuring the changes in permittivity, concentration of medically relevant biomolecules such as glucose, neurotransmitters, vitamins and proteins, ailments and abnormalities can be detected. In case of optical biosensors, any change in permittivity is transduced to a change in optical properties such as photoluminescence, interference pattern, reflection intensity and reflection angle through techniques like quantum dots, interferometry, surface enhanced raman scattering or surface plasmon resonance. Conversely, in case of RF, MW, mmW and THz biosensors, capacitive sensing is most commonly employed where changes in permittivity are reflected as changes in capacitance, through components like interdigitated electrodes, resonators and microstrip structures. In this paper, interactions of EM waves with biomatter are considered, with an emphasis on a clear demarcation of various modalities, their underlying principles and applications.},

  abstract = {Safe reuse of wastewater requires high levels of pathogen inactivation. Ozone is a very effective disinfectant for viruses and has distinct benefits over other forms of disinfectants, in that it increases the clarity of water and can oxidize some chemical contaminants in water. However, because of the combination of high ozone demand of most wastewaters and rapid reaction with viruses, determination of ozone dose in wastewater and recycled water treatment is not well defined. While various surrogates are used as indicator organisms for human pathogenic viruses in water reuse practice, much less is known about the relationship between surrogates and human pathogenic viruses for ozone disinfection in wastewater. In this study, the ozone inactivation dose response of several surrogates (Escherichia coli, coliphage T1, T4, PRD-1, ΦX174, and MS2) and human pathogenic viruses (poliovirus 1, echovirus 11, coxsackievirus B5, and adenovirus 2) were compared for the first time in secondary effluent wastewater. A unique reduction equivalent dose method was proposed to compare the inactivation of the microorganisms studied across waters with varying ozone demand. Inactivation of all viruses and surrogates studied was greater than 4\,log at ozone Ct levels of less than 1 (mg/L)-min. E. coli and PRD-1 were identified as conservative surrogates for indicating inactivation of human pathogenic viruses in ozone disinfection of wastewater, providing a tool for practitioners and regulators to confidently accept ozonation systems for virus inactivation in wastewater reuse.},

The device uses an electrokinetic process, induced charge electroosmosis [17], by which a flow through the device is driven by a set of charged obstacles in it. Its design is realized by manipulating the shape and orientation of the obstacles in order to maximize the amount of fluid mixing within the device. The computation entails the solution of a constrained optimization problem in which function evaluations require the numerical solution of a set of partial differential equations: a potential equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and a mass transport equation. The most expensive component of the function evaluation (which must be performed at every step of an iteration for the optimization) is the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that by using some new robust algorithms for this task [11, 16], based on certain preconditioners that take advantage of the structure of the linearized problem, this computation can be done efficiently. Using this computational strategy, in conjunction with a derivative-free pattern search algorithm for the optimization, applied to a finite element discretization of the problem, we are able to determine optimal configurations of microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Since 1959 with the proposal of Double Agar Layer (DAL) method for phage detection and quantification, many sophisticated methods have emerged meanwhile. However, many of them are either too complex/expensive or insensitive to replace routine utilization of DAL method in clinical, environmental and industrial environments. For that purpose, we have explored an alternative method for the detection and quantification of bacteriophages that fulfills the criteria of being rapid, simple and inexpensive. In this paper we have developed a method based on the analysis of optical density kinetics in bacterial cultures exposed to phage-containing samples. Although the decrease in optical density caused by cell lysis was one of the first observable consequences of the effect of viral infection in bacterial cultures, the potential of the method for the assessment of phage abundance has never been fully exploited. In this work we carry out a detailed study of optical density kinetics in phage-infected bacterial cultures, as a function of both, phage abundance and initial concentration of the host organisms. In total, 90 different combinations of bacteria/phage concentrations have been used. The data obtained provide valuable information about sensitivity ranges, duration of the assay, percentages of inhibition and type of lysing behavior for each phage concentration. The method described can detect, as few as 10 phage particles per assay volume after a phage incubation period of 3.5h. The duration of the assay can be shortened to 45min at the expense of losing sensitivity and increasing the limit of detection to 108 pfu/ml. Despite using non-sophisticated technology, the method described has shown sensitivity and response time comparable to other high-end methods. The simplicity of the technology and of the analytical steps involved, make the system susceptible of miniaturization and automation for high-throughput applications which can be implemented in routine analysis in many environments.},

Here, we discuss what is known about influenza virus assembly and budding, focusing on the viral and host factors that are involved in the determination of viral morphology. Whilst the biological function of the filamentous morphology remains unknown, recent results suggest a role in facilitating viral spread in vivo. We discuss these results and speculate on the consequences of viral morphology during influenza virus infection of the human respiratory tract.},

Motivated by the elastic network model, proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model, including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular assemblies of unknown atomic structure.},

The combined properties of the fluid and the elastomeric substrate result in a flexible and durable antenna that is well suited for conformal antenna applications. Injecting the metal into microfluidic channels provides a simple way to define the shape of the liquid, which is stabilized mechanically by a thin oxide skin that forms spontaneously on its surface. This approach has proven sufficient for forming simple, single layer antenna geometries, such as dipoles. More complex fluidic antennas, particularly those featuring large, co-planar sheet-like geometries, require additional design considerations to achieve the desired shape of the metal. Here, a multi-layer patch antenna is fabricated using specially designed serpentine channels that take advantage of the unique rheological properties of the liquid metal alloy. The flexibility of the resulting antennas is demonstrated and the antenna parameters are characterized through simulation and measurement in both the relaxed and flexed states.},

  abstract = {Background
Transbronchial lung biopsy is an important approach to diagnose peripheral lung cancer, but bronchoscopy based treatment options are limited and poorly studied. A flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled microwave ablation (MWA) catheter was developed to evaluate the feasibility and safety both in ex vivo and in vivo porcine models.

Methods
Using direct penetration of the catheter through the surface of ex vivo porcine lung, ablations (n=9) were performed at 70, 80, 90 W for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the catheter and 10, 15, 20 mm away from the tip were measured. Under bronchoscopy conditions in porcine lung, ablations (n=18, 6 in ex vivo and 12 in vivo) were performed at 80 W for 5 minutes. Computed tomography (CT) was acquired perioperative, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post ablation. Ablation zones were excised at 24 hours and 4 weeks respectively. Long-axis diameter (Dl) and short-axis diameter (Ds) were measured and tissues were sectioned for pathological examination.

Results
In-ex vivo lung, the temperature at 20 mm removed was over 60 °C at 80 W for 288±26 seconds. The ablations under bronchoscopic conditions were successful in-ex vivo and in vivo lung. No complications occurred during the procedures. Coagulation necrosis was visible at 24 hours, and repaired fibrous tissue was seen at 4 weeks.

Conclusions
The flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled MWA is feasible and safe. This early animal data holds promise of MWA becoming a potential therapeutic tool for Peripheral Lung Cancers.},

Taylor tapers give low sidelobes but high forelobes and aftlobes, plus a modest gain degradation. Inverse tapers give low forelobes and aftlobes but high sidelobes and large gain degradation. Uniform excitation gives comparable axial and transverse subsidiary lobes, and is probably the best choice. Focal shift, where the peak axial power density occurs between the aperture and the phase (geometric) focus, due to the1/R\^2factor, is accurately calculated for a uniform square aperture. Since peak axial power density available from a focused aperture depends only on aperture size in wavelengths and on distance, these focal shift results allow system trade-offs to be made.},

At the highest spinning rate, the molecular bond is broken and the molecule dissociates.},

  abstract = {Cnidaria catch and kill their prey by means of nematocysts. A nematocyst consists of a capsule containing a coiled tubule. On triggering, the cyst extrudes this tubule in an extremely rapid manner. The mechanisms and driving forces of discharge are still unknown. We found nematocysts of various cnidarians to be acidic inside and propose that the pH difference between cyst matrix and cytoplasm drives the discharge of cysts. For large cysts of Aiptasia we calculated that the internal concentration of protons and protonated carboxyl groups is about 5~M. Cysts contain polyacids in a high concentration. At a low pH several of the carboxyl groups of the polymer are uncharged. The carboxyl groups dissociate when, on triggering, the proton concentration becomes balanced across the cyst membrane. The speed of protons in water is extremely rapid. Thus, the equilibration of the proton concentration initially results in a negative net charge within the cyst and therefore in a sudden electrostatic repulsion between the dissociated carboxyl groups of the polymer. This causes an increase in the pressure of the matrix against the cyst wall. We suggest that this nonosmotic pressure increase causes the first and extremely rapid step of discharge. We propose that in a second step cations and water are taken up, generating an increase in osmotic pressure. A change in the pH value may also facilitate the invagination and evagination, respectively, of the tubule.},

  abstract = {There has been ongoing debate and discussion concerning whether the funding source influenced the outcome of research on human health effects from exposure to radiofrequency fields (RF, electromagnetic waves that carry energy as they propagate in air and dense media). In a study of 225 publications, in which we sought to determine a possible association between the funding source(s), quality and outcome in a total of 2,160 genetic damage assessment tests of mammalian cells exposed to RF energy, we made several observations. One finding was that a great majority of researchers had acknowledged government agencies as the funding source (53\%, 120 of 225 publications), while a small number of scientists mentioned mobile phone industry as the financial source (9\%, 20 of 225 publications). Numerous investigators did not mention the funding source (26\%, 58 of 225 publications). Secondly, industry-funded investigations were of better quality and utilized quality control measures, i.e., blind evaluation, adequate description of dosimetry, positive controls and/or sham-exposed controls, compared to those funded by the government. Another observation was that in industry-funded studies, the d values (effect size or standardized mean difference between the cells exposed to RF energy and sham-exposed controls) were consistently lower than in government-funded studies. In addition, compared to government-funded studies, a higher percentage of industry-funded studies reported no difference in genetic damage between RF- and sham-exposed cells (80\% for industry-funded studies versus 49\% for government-funded studies). Finally, we observed that industry-funded studies were less likely to report an increase in genetic damage in cells exposed to RF energy (10\%) compared to government-funded studies (23\%). In view of the large difference between the percentage of publications funded by government and industry (53\% or 122 of 225 publications for government, compared to 9\% or 29 of 225 publications for industry), caution should be used when debating and discussing the above observations. Overall, it is important to include the quality control measures in the investigations, and also mention the funding source in published studies.},

Will this trend continue to the power amplifier? Is this technology really cheaper to develop and manufacture RF product solutions than GaAs? Is SiGeC really the RF technology of the future, or only a short-lived fad to be pushed aside by RF CMOS? This paper will explore the driving factors behind these questions, and moreover, explore the product entry and manufacturing cost differences for GaAs HBT, and SiGeC BiCMOS technology.},

  abstract = {We have previously shown that 207-nm ultraviolet (UV) light has similar antimicrobial properties as typical germicidal UV light (254 nm), but without inducing mammalian skin damage. The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200-222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200-222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.},

The recent revolutionary technical advances in imaging, sequencing and lipid analysis have significantly boosted the depth and volume of knowledge on these viruses. This has resulted in new concepts of virus assembly, understanding of virion stability and dynamics, and the description of novel processes for viral genome packaging and membrane-driven genome delivery to the host. The detailed analyses of such processes have given novel insights into DNA transport across the protein-rich lipid bilayer and the transformation of spherical membrane structures into tubular nanotubes, resulting in the description of unexpectedly dynamic functions of the membrane structures. Membrane-containing phages have provided a framework for understanding virus evolution. The original observation on membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD1 and human pathogenic adenovirus has been fundamental in delineating the concept of “viral lineages”, postulating that the fold of the major capsid protein can be used as an evolutionary fingerprint to trace long-distance evolutionary relationships that are unrecognizable from the primary sequences. This has brought the early evolutionary paths of certain eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal viruses together, and potentially enables the reorganization of the nearly immeasurable virus population (\textasciitilde 1 × 1031) on Earth into a reasonably low number of groups representing different architectural principles. In addition, the research on membrane-containing phages can support the development of novel tools and strategies for human therapy and crop protection.},

The copy numbers of the major capsid protein, gp23*, of T2 and T4 phages were compared by quantitative gel electrophoresis. Taken together, the resulting values are most compatible with triangulation numbers T = 13 and Q = 21 for both T2 and T4, thus confirming the previously proposed capsid architecture of T4 revealed by indirect measurements and thereby eliminating the repeatedly reported discrepancy between T2 and T4 in favor of a common Q number of 21 corresponding to 960 copies of gp23*.},

This original configuration can dramatically improve the power and decrease the complexity of designing power amplifiers, leading to low cost and higher power. The HiVP uses a new concept, never achieved before, to simultaneously bias a semiconductor device at high voltage while maintaining an optimum output matching impedance close to 50 Ohms. The concept could be applied to many device technologies such as the GaAs MESFET, HEMT, and the Silicon MOSFET, to combine the power of several devices to achieve higher power output over broader bandwidth.},

The amplifier has 18 dB gain, and is ribbon bonded to the substrate on which the antenna is etched. The antenna is a microstrip array antenna with a simple etched pattern for producibility at high frequencies. Two antenna layouts are designed, for different coverage areas. A single array having 13.4 dBi directivity, and a double array with 14.6 dBi directivity. Antenna losses are approximately 1-2 dB, giving antenna gains of about 12 dBi and 13 dBi, respectively. Mechanical simplicity is achieved with this design, and unnecessary transitions are avoided. Measurements are performed on amplifier and antenna separately, as well as on the integrated design. Amplifier chips with and without BCB passivation are fabricated and measured for comparison.},

All volunteers receiving the higher phage dose showed fecal phage 1 day after exposure; this prevalence was only 50\% in subjects receiving the lower phage dose. No fecal phage was detectable a week after a 2-day course of oral phage application. Oral phage application did not cause a decrease in total fecal E. coli counts. In addition, no substantial phage T4 replication on the commensal E. coli population was observed. No adverse events related to phage application were reported. Serum transaminase levels remained in the normal range, and neither T4 phage nor T4-specific antibodies were observed in the serum of the subjects at the end of the study.

This paper gives examples of today’s regulatory requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the body. Simulation results show that about 34\% to 42\% of the incident power is reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation of safety compliance is proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.
Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.

Since that time, there has been a considerable body of science further addressing the relation between radiofrequency EMFs and adverse health outcomes, as well as significant developments in the technologies that use radiofrequency EMFs. Accordingly, ICNIRP has updated the radiofrequency EMF part of the 1998 Guidelines. This document presents these revised Guidelines, which provide protection for humans from exposure to EMFs from 100 kHz to 300 GHz.},

  abstract = {Cryo-EM maps are sensitive to total nuclear and electron charges of a species whereas X-ray crystallography only visualizes electrons without a nuclear contribution. Cryo-EM can be used to identify charge and chemical identity., Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) directly images the distribution of electrostatic potential (ESP) within macromolecules, and thus can provide much more information about atomic charge than X-ray crystallography. The electron-scattering length of an isolated ion is quite different from that of the corresponding neutral atom. The difference is very large at small scattering angles where the effects of electron distributions are largest, but becomes smaller at high scattering angles where nuclear charge determines outcomes. For this reason, in cryo-EM maps that have been solved at resolutions lower than ∼2.5\hspace{0.25em}Å, peaks corresponding to anions will always be less prominent than those of cations, and may even be negative. Furthermore, if a map of this kind is smeared computationally after the fact, which reduces its effective resolution, anion peaks will diminish in size, cation peaks will grow and peaks that represent uncharged atoms will remain about the same. These effects can be used to determine the sign of the charges carried by the ions associated with a macromolecule and even estimate their magnitudes. The ESP value for a cation in a cation–anion pair is smaller than the value of the cation in isolation, but the ESP value for the anion in the ionic pair is greater than the value of the anion in isolation. The experimental range of ESP values for Mg2+ relative to that of the closest C1′ atom is found to be between 0.57 and 1.27.},

  abstract = {The resistive and reactive components of an impedance, including the sign of the reactance, can be determined by placing a resistance and a reactance in series with the impedance and making five scalar voltage measurements across pairs of points in the resulting network. It is also possible, using suitable combinations of the same 5 measurements, to determine impedance magnitude, phase tangent, conductance, susceptance, power factor, and (by making the reference resistance equal to the target load resistance) reflection coefficient and SWR. This article gives expressions for all of these quantities; and includes an error analysis in each instance to show how a standard deviation can be calculated. The error functions are well-behaved except for those related to the voltage reflection coefficient, the expression for which is not differentiable when its value is in the region of zero. A solution to that problem is to place a potential divider across the generator and make an additional bridge voltage measurement, this configuration being the same as is used in antenna analysers and return loss bridges. Although not suitable for permanent insertion into a transmission line; the series network can be used for simultaneous determination of load resistance, conductance and phase tangent, as is required for guaranteed convergence of impedance matching procedures involving series and parallel reactances.},

The electrode interface impedance components (R/sub i/, X/sub i/) and the culture medium component R/sub m/ were separated by making use of the Warburg's model frequency dependent properties. Measurements were carried out from 18 Hz to 18 kHz with a constant current impedance bridge as growth proceeded. Growth curves for R/sub i/ and X/sub i/ showed a similar temporal pattern within the frequency range of 18-100 Hz. Dispersion was not observed in R/sub m/, meaning that the same growth response was obtained within the 18-18000-Hz range. At low frequency, the resistive and capacitive reactive components, or R/sub i/ and X/sub b/, respectively, were directly measured, where R/sub b/=(2*R/sub i/+R/sub m/) and X/sub b/=2*X/sub i/ and, above 5 kHz, R/sub m/ was obtained (for Z/sub i/ is negligible). Thus, R/sub i/ was easily discriminated from R/sub m/ by simple arithmetic. In four experiments, the maximum spread of X/sub i/, R/sub i/, and R/sub m/ was smaller than 5\% indicating good repeatability. There is potential new information in dissecting out the growth curve in three separate component curves.{$<>$}},

With this aim, both biocomponents have been immobilised in parallel onto interdigitated gold microelectrodes. The produced surfaces have been characterised by EIS and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy and have been applied to bacteria detection. Compared to immunocapture, detection using phages generates successive dual signals of opposite trend over time, which consist of an initial increase in impedance caused by bacteria capture followed by impedance decrease attributed to phage-induced lysis. Such dual signals can be easily distinguished from those caused by non-specific adsorption and/or crossbinding, which helps to circumvent one of the main drawbacks of reagentless biosensors based in a single target-binding event. The described strategy has generated specific detection of Escherichia coli in the range of 104–107 CFU mL−1 and minimal interference by non-target Lactobacillus. We propose that the utilisation of phages as capture biocomponent for bacteria capture and EIS detection allows in-chip signal confirmation.},

Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces.
Methods: The efficacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/ p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70\% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62\% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71\% ethanol).
Results: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log10 reduction factor of 3.2 for 70\% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62\% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71\% ethanol. For MHV, log10 reduction factors were 3.9 for 70\% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62\% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71\% ethanol.
Conclusion: Only ethanol reduced infectivity of the 2 coronaviruses by .3-log10 after 1 minute. Germicides must be chosen carefully to ensure they are effective against viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.},

  abstract = {A new approach is presented for modelling three-dimensional lumped elements in the "nite-di!erence time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations. The "nite-di!erence equations for the lumped element's circuit behaviour are derived to produce discrete relationships between the device's terminal currents and voltages. These di!erence equations are then implemented in the FDTD grid with equivalent voltage and current sources based on static "eld approximations. The method can be used for a wide range of applications which include lumped elements that may be passive, active, linear, non-linear, single, and multiple port devices. The underlying advantages of modelling a lumped element in this manner as compared to the more traditional extended FDTD technique is that the lumped element is easily extended across multiple FDTD cells and the need for a separate transcendental equation solver is eliminated. The method is demonstrated by a speci"c example based on the Curtice\vphantom\{\}Cubic non-linear model for a MESFET. The s-parameters from an FDTD simulation are compared to the manufacturer's measured data and to results from simulations using Hewlett-Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS). Finally, the method is used to model the MESFET in a three port oscillator. Copyright 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The continuous emergence of new influenza virus strains due to mutation and re-assortment complicates the control of the virus and necessitates the permanent development of novel drugs and vaccines. The laboratory-based study of influenza requires a reliable and cost-effective method for the propagation of the virus. Here, a comprehensive protocol is provided for influenza A virus propagation in fertile chicken eggs, which consistently yields high titer viral stocks. In brief, serum pathogen-free (SPF) fertilized chicken eggs are incubated at 37 °C and 55-60\% humidity for 10-11 days. Over this period, embryo development can be easily monitored using an egg candler. Virus inoculation is carried out by injection of virus stock into the allantoic cavity using a needle. After 2 days of incubation at 37 °C, the eggs are chilled for at least 4 hr at 4 °C. The eggshell above the air sac and the chorioallantoic membrane are then carefully opened, and the allantoic fluid containing the virus is harvested. The fluid is cleared from debris by centrifugation, aliquoted and transferred to -80 °C for long-term storage. The large amount (5-10 ml of virus-containing fluid per egg) and high virus titer which is usually achieved with this protocol has made the usage of eggs for virus preparation our favorable method, in particular for in vitro studies which require large quantities of virus in which high dosages of the same virus stock are needed.},

A semicircular spiral mounted on a dielectric substrate was simulated for computing the input impedance versus frequency. The gain and scattering computations were performed on a square Archimedean spiral mounted in a ground plane with a cavity backing. Total-field FDTD calculations are used to compute the impedance and gain patterns, while a specially modified scattered-field approach for aperture antennas in infinite ground planes is used for the scattering results. Comparisons are made with published impedance measurements and gain and scattering calculations done with a finite element method. Good results were obtained for impedance, radiation, and scattering.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {"Do you want to design a wireless transmitter or receiver for hand-held telephones? Have you wondered why the printed circuit wires on high-frequency circuits don't always run in a straight line? This valuable text will answer all of your questions regarding component parasitics and circuit characterization for rf/microwave amplifier, oscillator, and filter circuit design and analysis. You will understand why capacitors act as inductors and vice versa and why amplifiers work like oscillators, while oscillators for local area networks work more like local area heaters. Application of the information in Introduction to Microwave Circuits will reduce design-cycle time and costs, markedly increasing the probability of first-time success in printed circuit or monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) design. Several approaches are taken into consideration, such as the effects of currents on the ground plane, bypass and coupling capacitors, and nonlinear effects in linear circuits. Featured topics include: * Incorporation of component parasitics in the design cycle * Closed form solution to oscillator design * Odd mode stability analysis * PIN diode analysis for high-power switching applications An integrated design example of a 1.25 GHz amplifier, oscillator, and filter printed circuit is also included, which could be useful in printed circuit board designs from tens of megahertz to tens of gigahertz. Introduction to Microwave Circuits provides the tools necessary to analyze or synthesize microwave circuits. This text is an essential reference for undergraduate students, microwave engineers, and administrators. Also, it will assist experienced designers in other fields to meet the current rapid expansion of communication system applications and work effectively in microwave circuit design. About the Author Robert J. Weber began his prolific career in the Solid State Research Laboratory at the Collins Radio Company, later a part of Rockwell International. For 25 years, he worked on advanced development and applied research in the one- to ten-gigahertz frequency range and received several distinguished awards for his valuable contributions to the field. Dr. Weber is involved in ongoing experimental research in integrating microwave circuits with other devices such as MEMS, chemical sensors, and electro-optics. Also, he teaches microwave circuit design and fiber-optics communications at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University. Dr. Weber is an IEEE Fellow."

The grid drain-source bias voltage is 7.4V and the total drain current for the grid is 6.0A, resulting in an overall dc-to-rf efficiency of 23\%. The pattern of the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio was measured and found to be essentially independent of the radiation angle. The average SSB noise level was -87 dBc/Hz at an offset of 150 kHz from the carrier. An average improvement in the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio of 5 dB was measured for a 100-transistor grid compared to a 16-transistor grid.},

This electrostatic charge determines the mobility of the soft particle in an electric field and thus governs its colloidal behaviour which plays a major role in virus sorption processes. The pH value at which the net surface charge switches its sign is referred to as the isoelectric point (abbreviations: pI or IEP) and is a characteristic parameter of the virion in equilibrium with its environmental water chemistry. Here, we review the IEP measurements of viruses that replicate in hosts of kingdom plantae, bacteria and animalia. IEPs of viruses are found in pH range from 1.9 to 8.4; most frequently, they are measured in a band of 3.5 {$<$} IEP {$<$} 7. However, the data appear to be scattered widely within single virus species. This discrepancy is discussed and should be considered when IEP values are used to account for virus sorption processes.},

Compared with the conventional patch antenna, this patch antenna has a few advantageous features such as simple structure, wider bandwidth and low cost. The wideband property can be obtained by combining the wideband patch antenna and the wideband 180° phase shifter. Differential feeding is adopted in order to increase the symmetry of the radiation patterns. The geometry structure, working principle, design method and simulated results are described in detail. The designed antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 18.2\%, and its peak gain can reach about 7.43 dB.},

However, by making devices from epitaxially grown III–V layers that are separated from a growth substrate, one can recycle the growth substrate to reduce costs. Here, we show damage-free removal of an epitaxial single-crystal GaAs film from its GaAs growth substrate using a laser that is absorbed by a smaller band gap, pseudomorphic indium gallium arsenide nitride layer grown between the substrate and the GaAs film. The liftoff process transfers the GaAs film to a flexible polymer substrate, and the transferred GaAs layer is indistinguishable in structural quality from its growth substrate.},

Using rigorous virus purification, marked differences between virions and host were observed. Over 125 phospholipid species have been quantitated for three strains of influenza (HKx31- H3N2, PR8- H1N1, and VN1203- H5N1) grown in eggs. The glycerophospholipid composition of purified virions differs from that of the host or that of typical mammalian cells. Phosphatidylcholine is the major component in most mammalian cell membranes, while in purified virions phosphatidylethanolamine dominates. Due to its effects on membrane curvature, it is likely that the variations in its content are important to viral processing during infection. This integrated method of virion isolation with systematic analysis of glycerophospholipids provides a tool for the assessment of species specific biomarkers of viral pathogenicity.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a MEMS type ion-sorption micropump which works in low vacuum range – it allows efficient evacuation of gases starting from atmospheric pressure down to 1 hPa. This miniature pre-vacuum pump is realized as two-electrode siliconglass structure. Thanks to a very close inter-electrode distance it is possible to ignite a gas discharge even at 1000 hPa at voltage lower than 1000 V. The use of a silicon substrate as a getter material increases significantly pumping capacity. This pump is technologically compatible with earlier developed high vacuum micropump and after their integration they could cover a very wide pressure range from 1000 hPa down to 10−7 hPa. This would enable on-chip generation of vacuum in variety of miniaturized devices.},

X-ray diffraction study indicated the presence of BaSi2O5, BaAl2Si2O8 and Ba2Si3O8 secondary phases in addition to Al2O3 in the composite. The bulk ceramic sintered at 875 °C has κ of 4.80 and tan δ of 0.007 at 1 MHz. The composite shows good microwave dielectric properties: κ of 4.52, tan δ of 0.004 and τκ close to zero. The composite has a low CTE of 4.38 ppm/°C which is close to that of silicon used in microelectronic industry and thermal conductivity of 1.41 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature. The results indicate that the Al2O3 - AGC glass composite has good dielectric, thermal properties and is chemically compatible with Ag electrode indicating it as a promising candidate for low κ LTCC substrate applications.},

  abstract = {Turbidity describes the cloudiness, or clarity, of a liquid. It is a principal indicator of water quality, sensitive to any suspended solids present. Prior work has identified the lack of low-cost turbidity monitoring as a significant hurdle to overcome to improve water quality in many domains, especially in the developing world. Low-cost hand-held benchtop meters have been proposed. This work adapts and verifies the technology for continuous monitoring. Lab tests show the low-cost continuous monitor can achieve 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) accuracy in the range 0–100 NTU and costs approximately 64 USD in components to construct. This level of accuracy yields useful and actionable data about water quality and may be sufficient in certain applications where cost is a primary constraint. A 38-day continuous monitoring trial, including a step change in turbidity, showed promising results with a median error of 0.45 and 1.40 NTU for two different monitors. However, some noise was present in the readings resulting in a standard deviation of 1.90 and 6.55 NTU, respectively. The cause was primarily attributed to ambient light and bubbles in the piping. By controlling these noise sources, we believe the low-cost continuous turbidity monitor could be a useful tool in multiple domains.},

This is 25\% less than the prohead mass deduced from its polypeptide composition, and this finding implies that the bacteriophage T4 prohead is built of fewer polypeptide copies than previously reported. In contrast, the mass of mature heads measured by STEM, 194 ± 2 MDa, is in agreement with previous mass measurements of DNA and protein content, and it is consistent with the previously determined stoichiometry. This good agreement of average STEM values for proheads and mature heads with corresponding hydrodynamic measurements suggests that STEM allows faithful evaluation of the masses of large supramolecular assemblies (i.e., ⩾200 MDa) such as whole viruses or cellular organelles.},

The ejection force arises from the energy stored in the capsid as a consequence of the viral genome (double-stranded DNA) being strongly bent and crowded on itself. The resisting force is associated with the osmotic pressure exerted by the colloidal particles in the host solution. Indeed, recent experimental work has demonstrated that the extent of ejection can be progressively limited by increasing the external osmotic pressure; at a sufficiently high pressure the ejection is completely suppressed. We outline here a theoritical analysis that allows a determination of the internal (capsid) pressure by examining the different relations between force and pressure inside and outside the capsid, using the experimentally measured position of the force balance.},

During dehiscence, mechanical energy stored in specialized tissues is transferred to the seeds to increase their kinetic and potential energies. The resulting seed dispersal patterns have been investigated in some ballistic dispersers, but the mechanical performance of a launch mechanism of this type has not been measured. The properties of the energy storage tissue and the energy transfer efficiency of the launch mechanism were quantified in Impatiens capensis. In this species the valves forming the seed pod wall store mechanical energy. Their mass specific energy storage capacity (124\,J kg−1) was comparable with that of elastin and spring steel. The energy storage capacity of the pod tissues was determined by their level of hydration, suggesting a role for turgor pressure in the energy storage mechanism. During dehiscence the valves coiled inwards, collapsing the pod and ejecting the seeds. Dehiscence took 4.2±0.4\,ms (mean ±SEM, n=13). The estimated efficiency with which energy was transferred to the seeds was low (0.51±0.26\%, mean ±SEM, n=13). The mean seed launch angle (17.4±5.2, mean ±SEM, n=45) fell within the range predicted by a ballistic model to maximize dispersal distance. Low ballistic dispersal efficiency or effectiveness may be characteristic of species that also utilize secondary seed dispersal mechanisms.},

Here, we report a microfluidic long-term oxygenator which can support high-throughput parallel cell cultures under multiple defined oxygenation conditions (0 ppm – 42 ppm). An array of oxygen-nitrogen gas micro-mixers is developed and fabricated in the device to generate stable oxygen concentrations for the oxygenation process. A water-jacket layer located between the gas layer and the cell culture chamber is applied to block evaporation and maintain conditions of culture media in the chamber. Furthermore, we perform simulations and experiments to investigate the functions of the gas mixers and the water jackets. We also conduct culture experiments to study the long-term growth (up to one week) and aggregation of three selected dental bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Fusobacterium nucleatum) under ranges of oxygenation conditions. These particular results can provide important insights on their roles in the dental biofilm formation. Overall, this work demonstrates that the long-term microfluidic oxygenation approach can effectively regulate defined dissolved-oxygen levels in cell microenvironments. Importantly, this oxygenation approach can be further applied to general long-term analyses of cells for their behavioral, metabolic and genetic responses, and their biofilm formation processes.},

A laser-cutting method is applied to engrave structures in sheets of the tapes. After peeling off the tape liners, the structures could be easily integrated at room temperature with label-free optical waveguide biochips without further modifications or additional processing steps. It is shown that the well-defined and controllable height of the channels is advantageous for stopped-flow measurements of analyte binding. The easy fabrication of a fully transparent integrated sensor unit – tape cuvette system is also demonstrated for parallel microscopic investigations. The transparent unit was used to on-line monitor the surface adhesion of Salmonella cells on poly-l-lysine-coated biochip surfaces, followed by the straightforward microscopic visualization of the adhered bacterial cells. The material of the double sided tape is stable in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, its material is biocompatible, making it ideal for biological applications. Excellent, stable and reversible bonding of the microstructured tapes to biocompatible plastic and glass is also demonstrated. The simplicity of the fabrication at ambient temperatures makes the developed processes appealing for lab-on-a-chip applications, particularly if the bonded biochips are precious.},

  abstract = {A new type of microfluidic flow distributor (referred to as the mixed mode or MM-distributor) is proposed. Its performance characteristics are determined using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), both in the absence and the presence of clogging, which is an important problem in microfluidic systems. A comparison is made with two existing, well-performing distributor types: the bifurcating (BF) distributor and an optimized diverging distributor, the so-called radially interconnected (RI) distributor. It was found that, in the absence of clogging, the MM-distributor produces only a little more dispersion than the bifurcating (BF) distributor, but much less than the radially interconnected (RI) distributor. The dispersion in an MM-distributor also follows a similar dependency on its width (power ≅ 2) as the BF-distributor. The dispersion in the RI-distributor on the other hand displays a very disadvantageous 4th-order dependency on its width, prohibiting its use to distribute the flow across wide beds (order of millimeters or centimeters). These observations hold independently of the flow rate. With increasing degree of clogging, the MM-distributor rapidly becomes advantageous over the BF-distributor, owing to the fluid contact zones that are provided after each bifurcation step. This means that overall, and when the occurrence of clogging cannot be excluded, the MM-type distributor seems to offer the best possible compromise between the ability to cope with local clogging events and the dispersion in the absence of clogging.},

Our results show that E. coli DNA absorbs microwaves in the 8–12-GHz region substantially more efficiently than water, which is itself an extremely efficient absorber. The observed absorption is featureless and decreases slightly with increasing frequency. These observations are consistent with an explanation involving direct absorption by longitudinal acoustic modes of the double helix.},

  abstract = {Inactivation of collected viral aerosols is important for preventing a filter medium’s serving as a fomite. The focus of this study was to evaluate the inactivation efficiency (IE) achieved through filtration coupled with microwave irradiation. MS2 aerosolized through a Collison nebulizer was fed into the system and collected onto the filter. For in-flight microwave decontamination, microwave irradiation was applied to an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) filter supported on a SiC disk for three cycles of selected irradiation times per 10 min (i.e., 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min/10 min) at power levels ranging from 125 W to 375 W. The survival fraction (SF) on the substrate and the IE through the entire system were investigated to determine the efficacy of this approach. SF decreased and IE increased as microwave power level was increased (p = 0.02 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively) or the application time was extended (p = 0.03 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively). Both measures changed sharply above a threshold temperature of around 90°C and reached 2 logs at 116 and 109°C, respectively. The log SF and IE of –2.59 and 3.62, respectively, were observed when the operating condition of 375 W for 10 min/cycle was used and the SiC disk facilitated microwave absorption. When a quartz frit was used as a support instead of the SiC disk, log inactivation efficiencies of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3 were measured at relative humidities of 30\%, 60\% and 90\%, respectively, under the same irradiation conditions. Relative humidity is a significant parameter from 50–80°C (p = 0.01). The results demonstrate that microwave-assisted filtration systems can be used as an effective means for inactivating viruses.},

  abstract = {In this project we pursue the development of a novel miniature submillimeter-wave magnetron oscillator (SMO) which combined vacuum tube technology with solid-state microfabrication technology. The SMO is a compact, rugged and lightweight terahertz source capable of operating in the nearly unexplored near- and far-infrared electromagnetic spectrum. It will provide high power, highly efficient THz radiation for active illumination and/or local oscillators for applications in compact sensor arrays for THz imaging. Civilian applications of these devices include high-resolution radar, satellite telecommunications, remote sensing, line-of-sight networking, plasma and solid-state diagnostics, and high-speed computing. Other military applications of the SMO include line-of-sight networking and communications as well as chemical and biological spectroscopy. In the SMO, a tiny electron beam produced by a micron-sized cold-cathode interacts with the millimeter-wave fields of a miniature multi-vane cylindrical microcavity where the beam, as it rotates about the cavity axis, generates a terahertz signal inside the microcavity. The highly desirable features of the SMO, such as high power and its miniature size, make for an ultrahigh frequency vacuum microtube that has the potential to revolutionize the millimeter-wave tube industry. Once fully developed, the SMO should represent a multi-million dollar market.},

  abstract = {Characterization of the frequency response of coherent radiometric receivers is a key element in estimating the flux of astrophysical emissions, since the measured signal depends on the convolution of the source spectral emission with the instrument band shape. Laboratory Radio Frequency (RF) measurements of the instrument bandpass often require complex test setups and are subject to a number of systematic effects driven by thermal issues and impedance matching, particularly if cryogenic operation is involved. In this paper we present an approach to modeling radiometers bandpasses by integrating simulations and RF measurements of individual components. This method is based on QUCS (Quasi Universal Circuit Simulator), an open-source circuit simulator, which gives the flexibility of choosing among the available devices, implementing new analytical software models or using measured S-parameters. Therefore an independent estimate of the instrument bandpass is achieved using standard individual component measurements and validated analytical simulations. In order to automate the process of preparing input data, running simulations and exporting results we developed the Python package python-qucs and released it under GNU Public License. We discuss, as working cases, bandpass response modeling of the COFE and Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) radiometers and compare results obtained with QUCS and with a commercial circuit simulator software. The main purpose of bandpass modeling in COFE is to optimize component matching, while in LFI they represent the best estimation of frequency response, since end-to-end measurements were strongly affected by systematic effects.},

  abstract = {Coronaviruses are large, enveloped RNA viruses of both medical and veterinary importance. Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly.},

Therefore, there is a need and urgency for sensitive, specific, accurate, easy-to-use diagnostic tests. Versatile biofunctionalized engineered nanomaterials are proving to be promising in meeting these needs in diagnosing the pathogens in food, blood and clinical samples. The unique optical and magnetic properties of the nanoscale materials have been put to use for the diagnostics. In this review, we focus on the developments of the fluorescent nanoparticles, metallic nanostructures and superparamagnetic nanoparticles for bioimaging and detection of infectious microorganisms. The various nanodiagnostic assays developed to image, detect and capture infectious virus and bacteria in solutions, food or biological samples in vitro and in vivo are presented and their relevance to developing countries is discussed.},

This method utilizes near-field data to determine an equivalent magnetic current source over a fictitious surface which encompasses the antenna. This magnetic current, once determined, can be used to ascertain the near and the far fields. This method demonstrates that once the values of the electromagnetic field are known over an arbitrary geometry, its values for any other region can be obtained. An electric field integral equation is developed to relate the near fields to the equivalent magnetic current. A moment method procedure is employed to solve the integral equation by transforming it into a matrix equation. A least squares solution via singular value decomposition is used to solve the matrix equation. Computations with both synthetic and experimental data, where the near field of several antenna configurations are measured over various geometric surfaces, illustrate the accuracy of this method.

  abstract = {Microbial pathogens of respiratory infectious diseases are often transmitted through particles in sneeze and cough. Therefore, understanding the particle movement is important for infection control. Images of a sneeze induced by nasal cavity stimulation by healthy adult volunteers, were taken by a digital high-vision, high-speed video system equipped with a computer system and treated as a research model. The obtained images were enhanced electronically, converted to digital images every 1/300 s, and subjected to vector analysis of the bioparticles contained in the whole sneeze cloud using automatic image processing software. The initial velocity of the particles or their clusters in the sneeze was greater than 6 m/s, but decreased as the particles moved forward; the momentums of the particles seemed to be lost by 0.15–0.20 s and started a diffusion movement. An approximate equation of a function of elapsed time for their velocity was obtained from the vector analysis to represent the dynamics of the front-line particles. This methodology was also applied for a cough. Microclouds contained in a smoke exhaled with a voluntary cough by a volunteer after smoking one breath of cigarette, were traced as the visible, aerodynamic surrogates for invisible bioparticles of cough. The smoke cough microclouds had an initial velocity greater than 5 m/s. The fastest microclouds were located at the forefront of cloud mass that moving forward; however, their velocity clearly decreased after 0.05 s and they began to diffuse in the environmental airflow. The maximum direct reaches of the particles and microclouds driven by sneezing and coughing unaffected by environmental airflows were estimated by calculations using the obtained equations to be about 84 cm and 30 cm from the mouth, respectively, both achieved in about 0.2 s, suggesting that data relating to the dynamics of sneeze and cough became available by calculation.},

For the purpose of obtaining insulation materials with desirable dielectric and electrical resistance properties, we investigated several fillers with nonlinear electrical properties doped in silicon rubber composites, and their dependency on the temperature and field. The samples of silicone rubber composites with different components were prepared using barium strontium titanate (BST) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as the filler, and high temperature vulcanized silicone rubber (SiR) as the matrix. The investigations revealed that the BST-doped samples showed different dielectric properties compared to ZnO-doped composites, with an increase in the electric field, which was nonlinear. The resistivity of both doped samples was similar. Results demonstrated that it was possible to achieve higher values of permittivity, and lower values of tanδ and resistivity, with respect to unfilled silicone rubber composites over a wide electrical field and temperature range. Discussion of the results attributes these important functional behaviours to the spontaneous polarization of nonlinear nanoparticles and the interaction between the SiR chains and the nonlinear nanoparticles at the interfacial area.},

Fusion proteins were competitively incorporated into the phage capsid. It allowed effective separation of T4 from a contaminating phage on standard affinity resins.},

The key device in the system is the two-port phase modulator, which functions, in conjunction with a dispersive element in the loop, to form a high-Q microwave filter to perform microwave frequency selection. The central frequency of the microwave filter is a function of the optical wavelength and the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive element, therefore, the oscil-lation frequency can be simply tuned by tuning the wavelength of the laser source or the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive ele-ment. A theoretical analysis is provided, which is verified by exper-iments. The phase noise performance and the frequency tunability are both experimentally investigated.

  abstract = {Two main groups of flow distributors, viz. “bifurcating distributors” (BF) and “radially interconnected distributors” (RI), as well as some hybrid distributors were investigated. Computational fluid dynamics was used to evaluate the performance of the distributors and to establish the design yielding the most uniform velocity field and the smallest variance for the bands emerging from the distributor. A minimum channel width of 100 ␮m was considered to allow the use of micro-milling techniques for chip fabrication. The main factors that influenced the values of band variances were identified. The performance of the distributors was found to correlate most strongly with the volume of the flow distributors. The separation bed should be positioned immediately after, but not against the flow distributor. It was concluded that BF distributors perform best in terms of band variance. The values of band variances for the BF distributor decreased with increasing angle between bifurcation branches and the lowest value of about 0.01 mm2 was found for ˛ = 175◦. Both BF and RI flow distributors were found to perform reasonably well when imperfections were present in the structure. However, severe blockages (exceeding 75\% of the cross-sectional area and length) of channels in, especially, BF flow distributors may jeopardize their performance.},

Of these, a mere 10,733 phages have been isolated and 2,061 phages have sequenced, complete genomes, with even fewer, only 1,073, presently publicly available in the NCBI GenBank database. “Phagehunting” is the process of isolation, characterization, and genomic analyses of phages that infect bacterial hosts. There is considerable interest in using phages as diagnostics and therapeutics of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. One such MDR bacterium is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, whose phages can be isolated on the easy-to-grow non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. Since current phagehunting procedures of Mycobacterium phages all use identical plating conditions, we would like to explore alternative phagehunting procedures to determine if that affects the type of phages isolated. To date, no phages within the Podoviridae family have been isolated that infect Mycobacteria. With these new optimized procedures, we would like to pilot a program, contingent on the success of this study, to expose high school students to the field of molecular and synthetic genomics. We examined the precise conditions required in each step of the phagehunting process to successfully obtain phage. With the use of careful phage isolation procedures and environmental samples from various locations, such as alternative media usage and modified plaque-picking methods, we isolated potentially novel phages. One of these phages, Kalon1, has been isolated and preliminarily characterized. The success of this study may provide the foundation for an improved program for high school students to foster their interest in research and gain invaluable experiences outside of the classroom while providing bacteriophages that can serve as the base chassis of synthetically engineered phages for diagnosis and treatment of MDR pathogens. Lastly, by creating a generalizable standardized process to obtain phages, we may broaden the horizon for new exploration of novel phages and advances in phage therapy of any MDR pathogen.},

  abstract = {We previously identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS‐CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS‐CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS‐CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS. SARS‐CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle. These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS‐CoV may also be targets of SARS‐CoV infection. The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS‐CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS‐CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways. This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS. Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A major limitation with traditional phage preparations is the variability in titer, salts, and bacterial contaminants between successive propagations. Here we introduce the Phage On Tap (PoT) protocol for the quick and efficient preparation of homogenous bacteriophage (phage) stocks. This method produces homogenous, laboratory-scale, high titer (up to 1010–11 PFU·ml−1), endotoxin reduced phage banks that can be used to eliminate the variability between phage propagations and improve the molecular characterizations of phage. The method consists of five major parts, including phage propagation, phage clean up by 0.22 μm filtering and chloroform treatment, phage concentration by ultrafiltration, endotoxin removal, and the preparation and storage of phage banks for continuous laboratory use. From a starting liquid lysate of {$>$} 100 mL, the PoT protocol generated a clean, homogenous, laboratory phage bank with a phage recovery efficiency of 85\% within just two days. In contrast, the traditional method took upwards of five days to produce a high titer, but lower volume phage stock with a recovery efficiency of only 4\%. Phage banks can be further purified for the removal of bacterial endotoxins, reducing endotoxin concentrations by over 3,000-fold while maintaining phage titer. The PoT protocol focused on T-like phages, but is broadly applicable to a variety of phages that can be propagated to sufficient titer, producing homogenous, high titer phage banks that are applicable for molecular and cellular assays.},

These include desirable characteristics such as a relatively broad host range and a lack of other characteristics such as carrying toxin genes and the ability to form a lysogen. While phages are commonly isolated first and subsequently characterized, it is possible to alter isolation procedures to bias the isolation toward phages with desirable characteristics. Some of these variations are regularly used by some groups while others have only been shown in a few publications. In this review I will describe (1) isolation procedures and variations that are designed to isolate phages with broader host ranges, (2) characterization procedures used to show that a phage may have utility in phage therapy, including some of the limits of such characterization, and (3) results of a survey and discussion with phage researchers in industry and academia on the practice of characterization of phages.},

It is shown that when phase shifters are used within the architecture of the array, the focal point moves as a function of frequency, which degrades the focusing performance of the antenna. To mitigate these limitations, time-delay units are proposed, and it is revealed that perfect focusing across a wide bandwidth can be achieved by this approach. To validate this concept, an UWB Vivaldi focused antenna array using time delays is designed which demonstrates good focusing capability across the UWB spectrum.},

The problems of thermometry in the presence of electromagnetic fields fall outside the scope of this article. Their solution, however, is no less important to the future of clinical hyperthermia than the development of heating techniques.

  abstract = {Centrifugal microfluidics has emerged as a unique approach to the development of integrated total analysis systems for medical diagnostics. However, despite its many advantages, the platform has a size limitation due to the centripetal pumping mechanism in which fluids can only be moved from the center of the disc to the rim. This limits the footprint of the microfluidic network to one radius of the disc, and this in turn limits the amount of space available to embed complex assays. In order to overcome this space limitation problem, we are developing new techniques to pump fluids back toward the center of the disc as to allow greater path lengths for the fluidic network. This study presents a novel pumping mechanism for centrifugal microfluidics utilizing a combination of centrifugation and pneumatic compression. Pneumatic energy is stored during high-speed centrifugation with sample fluids trapping then compressing air in specially designed chambers. The accumulated pneumatic energy is released by spinning down, which expands the trapped air and thus pumps liquids back toward the center of the CD. This newly developed method overcomes current limitations of centripetal pumping avoiding external manipulation or surface treatments. In this article, we explore the design of appropriate chambers to induce pneumatic pumping and analytically describe the mechanics behind the pumping action. For proof of principle, we have applied pneumatic pumping to siphon priming.},

In the design, special attention was given to the matter of reducing back lobe radiation effects using the concept of asymmetric positioning of the radiators with respect to the ground plane. Afterward, the main lobe axial ratio behavior for several beam steering and side lobe level conditions are investigated. Finally, the polarization reconfigurability is achieved and the design is validated through the good agreement between theoretical and experimental results.},

  abstract = {Using polymer materials to fabricate microfluidic devices provides simple, cost effective, and disposal advantages for both lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices and micro total analysis systems (µTAS). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer and thermoplastics are the two major polymer materials used in microfluidics. The fabrication of PDMS and thermoplastic microfluidic device can be categorized as front-end polymer microchannel fabrication and post-end microfluidic bonding procedures, respectively. PDMS and thermoplastic materials each have unique advantages and their use is indispensable in polymer microfluidics. Therefore, the proper selection of polymer microfabrication is necessary for the successful application of microfluidics. In this paper, we give a short overview of polymer microfabrication methods for microfluidics and discuss current challenges and future opportunities for research in polymer microfluidics fabrication. We summarize standard approaches, as well as state-of-art polymer microfluidic fabrication methods. Currently, the polymer microfluidic device is at the stage of technology transition from research labs to commercial production. Thus, critical consideration is also required with respect to the commercialization aspects of fabricating polymer microfluidics. This article provides easy-to-understand illustrations and targets to assist the research community in selecting proper polymer microfabrication strategies in microfluidics.},

One of the most important properties computed for a transmission line is its characteristic impedance, which is often used in the extraction of the equivalent circuit model of an interconnection discontinuity. The calculation of the characteristic impedance from FDTD numerical results seems to be trivial it can simply be obtained by the ratio of the Fourier transformed voltage and the Fourier transformed current. However, it is shown that, if the characteristic impedance is not calculated properly, significant amount of error can be introduced in its numerical solution.},

isoelectric points for 5029 proteomes calculated using 18 methods. The isoelectric point,
the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important
parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D
gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry and X-ray protein crystallography. The database, available at http://isoelectricpointdb.org
allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customised fractions
of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover,
Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various
prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space
in all kingdoms of life. For instance, using Proteome-pI data, it is
clear that Eukaryotes, which evolved tight control of homeostasis, encode proteins with
pI values near the cell pH. In contrast, Archaea living frequently in
extreme environments can possess proteins with a wide range of isoelectric points. The
database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and
sorting. Apart from data for individual proteomes, datasets corresponding to major protein
databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr)

Its surface contains a phospholipid bilayer, within which are embedded the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, arranged with icosahedral geometry. Exposure to low pH triggers the E proteins to undergo conformational changes, which precede fusion with the host cell membrane and release of the viral genome. The flavivirus membrane exhibits significant local curvature and deformation, as revealed by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), but its precise structure and interactions with envelope components remain unclear. We now report simulations of the dengue viral particle that refine its envelope structure in unprecedented detail. Our final models are morphologically consistent with cryo-EM data, and reveal the structural basis for membrane curvature. Electrostatic interactions increased envelope complex stability; this coupling has potential functional significance in the context of the viral fusion mechanism and infective states.},

  abstract = {With increasing complexities and shrinking size of modern electronic devices, the near-field RF interference issues are becoming challenging for RF-digital mixed circuit design. Predicting the coupling from digital module to RF antennas and mitigating RF interference is important to the system performance. The ultimate goal of this study is to address the desensitization issues existing in modern electronic devices that have mixed high speed digital-RF circuits, such as cellphone and wearable devices. In order to estimate the near-field noise coupling from digital module to RF antennas, the noise source is anticipated to be replaced by its equivalent radiation model which can facilitate the near-field coupling analysis. This thesis focuses on modeling of radiation noise source and its application in RF interference applications. Two methods are proposed, equivalent dipole moment model and Huygens’s equivalent model. The methodology of both methods will be introduced and later validated with full-wave simulation and measurement. Dipole moment model is extracted by Least-square and improved with global optimization, while Huygens’s equivalent model is constructed in full-wave simulation tool. With equivalent noise source model, the near-field coupling between radiation noise source and RF antennas are estimated by either direct simulation or reciprocity theorem. Field data is obtained by near-field scanning with phase information. Measurement data shows good correlation and consistence for noise source modeling and near-field coupling.},

Serwer, Electrophoresis 1983, 3, 375–382) have been used for the first time to detect and characterize plant viruses. PMV and some SAD strains produce two particles that copurify during rate zonal sedimentation, but form separate bands during agarose gel electrophoresis (forms 1 and 2). By measuring electrophoretic mobility (μ) as a function of agarose percentage and correcting for electroosmosis, it was found that: (a) form 1 has a solid support-free μ (μ0) different from the μ0 of form 2, and (b) forms 1 and 2 have the same radius (14.6 ± 0.6nm). Form 1 is indistinguishable from form 2 by either electron microscopy or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The μ0 of form 1 and the relative amount of forms 1 and 2 vary with the virus strain and can be used to help identify strains. A previously described satellite of PMV and some SAD strains also has two forms. The radius of the satellite of one SAD strain was found to be 7.6 ± 0.3 nm. A procedure of differential gel staining was developed for distinguishing the 14.6 nm virus from its 7.6 nm satellite. After agarose gel electrophoresis of either totally unfractionated or partially fractionated, infected grass extracts, virus particles wer detected without interference from host components. The procedures used here should be useful for rapid disease diagnosis and strain typing of the above and possibly other plant viruses.},

The increasing frequency and magnitude of viral outbreaks in recent decades has resulted in an urgent need for diagnostic methods that are facile, sensitive, rapid and inexpensive. Here, we describe and characterise a novel, calcium-mediated interaction of the surface of enveloped viruses with DNA, that can be used for the functionalisation of intact virus particles via chemical groups attached to the DNA. Using DNA modified with fluorophores, we have demonstrated the rapid and sensitive labelling and detection of influenza and other viruses using single-particle tracking and particle-size determination. With this method, we have detected clinical isolates of influenza in just one minute, significantly faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests. This powerful technique is easily extendable to a wide range of other enveloped pathogenic viruses and holds significant promise as a future diagnostic tool.},

They are found to be the n\,=\,4N-2 modes of the longitudinal modes of the nanorods, where N is an integer starting from 1 and n is the mode order quantum number. This study was confirmed by measuring the microwave absorption spectra of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), which is a rod-shaped virus. This is also the first study to identify the “dipolar-like” mode in a rod-shaped nano-object. Our study is not only an important step to achieve rapid and sensitive detection of rod-shaped viruses based on their microwave spectroscopic features and a non-contact method to measure the Young’s modulus of rod-shaped viruses, but also is critical to formulate an efficient epidemic prevention strategy to deactivate viruses with the structure-resonant microwaves.},

  abstract = {The biological effects of modulated radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields have been a subject of debate since early publications more than 30 years ago, suggesting that relatively weak amplitude-modulated RF electromagnetic fields have specific biological effects different from the well-known thermal effects of RF energy. This discussion has been recently activated by the increasing human exposure to RF fields from wireless communication systems. Modulation is used in all wireless communication systems to enable the signal to carry information. A previous review in 1998 indicated that experimental evidence for modulation-specific effects of RF energy is weak. This article reviews recent studies (published after 1998) on the biological effects of modulated RF fields. The focus is on studies that have compared the effects of modulated and unmodulated (continuous wave) RF fields, or compared the effects of different kinds of modulations; studies that used only one type of signal are not included. While the majority of recent studies have reported no modulation-specific effects, there are a few interesting exceptions indicating that there may be specific effects from amplitude-modulated RF fields on the human central nervous system. These findings warrant follow-up studies. Bioelectromagnetics 32:511–534, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the design of watt-level integrated CMOS RF power amplifiers (PAs) and state-of-the-art results in the literature. To reach watt-level output power from a single-chip CMOS PA, two main strategies can be identified: use of high supply voltage, and use of matching and power combination. High supply voltage limits are closely related to device design in the fabrication process. However, the maximum operating voltage can be improved by amplifier class selection, circuit solutions, and process modifications or mask changes. High output power can also be reached by the use of on-chip matching and power combination, commonly using on-chip transformers. Reliability often sets the limits for the PA design, and PA degradation mechanisms are reviewed. A compilation of state-of-the-art published results for linear and switched wattlevel PAs, as well as a few fully integrated CMOS PAs, is presented and discussed.},

These effects are found to be extremely important and substantial, introducing qualitative changes in the charge state of the capsid such as a transition from net-positive to net-negative charge depending on the solution pH. The overall charge of the virus capsid arises as a consequence of a complicated balance with the chemical dissociation equilibrium of the amino acids and the electrostatic interaction between them, and the translational entropy of the mobile solution ions, i.e., counterion release. We show that to properly describe and predict the charging equilibrium of viral capsids in general, one needs to include molecular details as exemplified by the acid-base equilibrium of the detailed distribution of amino acids in the proteinaceous capsid shell.},

  abstract = {The rapid translation of research from bench to bedside, as well as the generation of commercial impact, has never been more important for both academic and industrial researchers. It is therefore unsurprising that more and more microfluidic groups are investigating research using a wide range of thermoplastics which can be readily translated to large-scale manufacturing, if the technology is taken to commercialisation. While structuring, via additive or subtractive manufacturing, is becoming relatively easy through the use of commercial-grade devices, reliable and fast assembly remains a challenge. In this article, we propose an innocuous and cost-effective, under 2-min technique which enables the bonding of multiple poly(methyl methacrylate) layers. This bonding technique relies on the application of small amounts (10~µl/cm2) of ethanol, low temperatures (70~°C) and relatively low pressures (\textasciitilde 1.6~MPa). Our characterisation analysis shows that using a bonding time of 2~min is enough to produce a strong bond able to withstand pressures always above 6.2~MPa (with mean of 8~MPa, highest reported in the literature), with minimal channel deformation ({$<$}5\%). This technique, which we demonstrate on assembly comprising up to 19 layers, presents an exciting improvement in the field of rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices, enabling extremely fast design cycles in microfluidic research with a material compatible with mass manufacturing, thus allowing a smoother transition from the laboratory to the market. Beyond the research community, this robust prototyping technique has the potential to impact on the deliverability of other scientific endeavours including educational projects and will directly fuel the fluidic maker movement.},

  abstract = {Objectives:
Saliva contains a variety of host defense factors. It influences calculus formation and periodontal disease. Different studies have been done to find exact correlation of salivary biomarkers with periodontal disease. With a multitude of biomarkers and complexities in their determination, the salivary pH may be tried to be used as a quick chairside test. The aim of this study was to analyze the pH of saliva and determine its relevance to the severity of periodontal disease.

Study Design:
The study population consisted of 300 patients. They were divided into three groups of 100 patients each: Group A had clinically healthy gingiva, Group B who had generalized chronic gingivitis and Group C who had generalized chronic periodontitis. The randomized unstimulated saliva from each patient was collected and pH was tested. Data was analyzed statistically using analysis of variance technique.

Results:
The salivary pH was more alkaline for patients with generalized chronic gingivitis as compared with the control group (P = 0.001) whereas patients with generalized chronic periodontitis had more acidic pH as compared with the control group (P = 0.001).

Conclusion:
These results indicate a significant change in the pH depending on the severity of the periodontal condition. The salivary pH shows significant changes and thus relevance to the severity of periodontal disease. Salivary pH may thus be used as a quick chairside diagnostic biomarker.},

The safety assessment of an antenna is required prior to its radiation interaction with biological tissues. In this work, a specially designed and developed Vivaldi antenna with directivity at 45° for microwave holographic imaging has been presented. A detailed simulation of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and thermal analysis due to the radiation exposure of the designed antenna on self-designed anatomically real breast phantoms is performed in CST environment. SAR values for 3D printed breast phantoms are also calculated experimentally. The quantitative results of SAR reveal the variation of ±10\% in between the simulation and experimental results. It has been found that SAR due to the radiation of the designed antenna lies in the permissible limit. The thermal analysis in CST shows the rise of 0.096\% in temperature after the exposure of 2 hours. Hence, the antenna can be used in microwave holography for breast cancer detection.},

We identified only one study documenting surface disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a {$>$}6.6 log reduction after 5-minute exposure to 0.5\% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small-scale tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1\% and 0.5\% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by {$>$}4.8 log after only 1-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus.},

Three subtypes of AI viruses with different complex refractive indexes (CRIs) were detected at the THz frequency regime. The optical properties of the viruses in the THz frequency range were first measured, and the real and imaginary parts of their CRI are also plotted to investigate the sensing/detecting applications. We observed the resonance frequency shift of the THz MM following the deposition of the viruses on the surface of the proposed design. As an RI sensing application, we show that, with placing different sensing materials in vicinity of the nano sensor/detector device, the reflected resonance frequency changes, which, in turn, leads to measuring the sensitivity of the nano sensor/detector to detect the AI viruses. We investigate the detection of three subtypes of AI viruses with different protein concentrations and different RI values. We observed the resonance-frequency shift of the THz nano bio-sensor/detector following the RI changing of the detected viruses. The resonance shift is higher for the H9N2 virus, which has a relatively large amount of real part of the RI. Thus, the frequency shift decreases with lower amount of the RI real part. Additionally, we show that the magnitude of the reflection spectrum will be enhanced in larger amount of imaginary parts of the RI. This results from a combination of size-related factors, leading to field enhancement accompanying strong field localization.},

The microstrip patch acts as both the radiating element and the optimal FET drain load impedance required for oscillator synthesis. The active patch element operates as a series feedback oscillator and the microstrip patch is resonated in its fundamental mode. An NEC 71084 packaged FET is used as the active device in the patch element which itself is constructed on RT-Duroid 5880 material. The element has a free running frequency of 9.625 GHz (at 3 V) and exhibits excellent electrical characteristics. Experimental results are presented for the frequency pushing characteristics of the element which are nearly linear. The active element is capable of producing an output power level of 8mW with 10\% efficiency at 2.3 V, and has an external Q factor of 32.},

Several relatively straightforward approaches have been suggested, including gap and frill feeds. More complicated approaches, which involve including the coaxial feed cable in the FDTD calculation space, have also been suggested. A related aspect is the desirability of reducing the number of time steps required for FDTD calculations to converge, especially for transient excitation. In this paper we illustrate that for many geometries a simple gap model with an internal source resistance provides accurate results while greatly reducing the number of time steps required for convergence.},

Now, this method rivals X-ray crystallography in terms of resolution and can be used to determine atomic structures of macromolecules that are either refractory to crystallization or difficult to crystallize in specific functional states. In this review, I discuss the recent breakthroughs in both hardware and software that transformed cryo-microscopy, enabling understanding of complex biomolecules and their functions at atomic level.},

  abstract = {The numerical study of physical problems often require integrating the dynamics of a large number of particles evolving according to a given set of equations. Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing (HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure) represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of the whole set of particles. The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and multi-purpose GPUs. Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user defined heterogeneous data structures.},

  abstract = {The analysis of the stresses in one-, two- and three-dimensional spinning bodies is discussed in a systematic and comprehensive way. First elastic solutions are derived for rods, for elliptical-shaped flat disks and for ellipsoidal solid bodies spinning about their sideways axes. Then the spins for first plastic yield are found in each case using each of the Tresca and the von Mises yield conditions. Then upper and lower bounds on the maximum allowable limit spins where the body would globally fail assuming perfectly plastic behavior are derived. The elastic solutions at first yield always give a lower bound to that limit spin, but global failure generally does not occur until the spin is increased. A way to calculate an improved lower bound is illustrated. Upper bounds are found in a simple and new way. The method uses the fact that the volume-averaged stresses can be calculated directly from the loadings without the need for any actual stress solutions, and then it is proved that the use of those average stresses in the yield functions always gives an upper bound to the limit loads. That use of the statically determinate average stresses to obtain meaningful plastic upper bounds to limit loads is though to be a new method, and can be applied to any shape. Finally, several finite element calculations are used to determine the quantitative relations between the lower and upper bounds and the actual limit spins for ellipsoidal bodies. The results are of interest in the spin of planetary bodies, where they explain the nature of an average-stress approximate method, and in the analysis of spinning bodies in general. In addition, the approach gives a very interesting example of the utility of the limit analysis approaches of plasticity theories.},

The method yields the polymer surface rich in carboxylic acid groups and may thus be also useful for further surface modification protocols (e.g. immobilization of enzymes on the surface of the polymer). The method has been designed particularly for use in microfluidics applications. The surfaces obtained via the method are extremely durable and can be stored without any special conditions for at least one year.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of different sterilization techniques and to compare the characteristics of the material before and after sterilization of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microchips. For this, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) along with standard sterilization methods such as ultraviolet (UV), heat (autoclaving), ethylene oxide (EtO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were applied. The treated microchips were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Laser Scanning Microscopy in order to ascertain any changes in the chemical structure and surface morphology. The optimum sterilization parameters for SC-CO2 were elicited as 120bar, 40°C and 60min which provided complete sterility and did not alter the main properties of the polymer along with EtO and H2O2 sterilizations unlike heat and UV treatments. However, surface roughness and microchannel profiles were negatively affected. Although complete sterility was achieved, each protocol has its own strengths and weaknesses.},

  abstract = {The Coronaviridae family is characterized by a nucleocapsid that is composed of the genome RNA molecule in combination with the nucleoprotein (N protein) within a virion. The most striking physiochemical feature of the N protein of SARS-CoV is that it is a typical basic protein with a high predicted pI and high hydrophilicity, which is consistent with its function of binding to the ribophosphate backbone of the RNA molecule. The predicted high extent of phosphorylation of the N protein on multiple candidate phosphorylation sites demonstrates that it would be related to important functions, such as RNA-binding and localization to the nucleolus of host cells. Subsequent study shows that there is an SR-rich region in the N protein and this region might be involved in the protein-protein interaction. The abundant antigenic sites predicted in the N protein, as well as experimental evidence with synthesized polypeptides, indicate that the N protein is one of the major antigens of the SARS-CoV. Compared with other viral structural proteins, the low variation rate of the N protein with regards to its size suggests its importance to the survival of the virus.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophage T4 is the most well-studied member of Myoviridae, the most complex family of tailed phages. T4 assembly is divided into three independent pathways: the head, the tail and the long tail fibers. The prolate head encapsidates a 172 kbp concatemeric dsDNA genome. The 925 Å-long tail is surrounded by the contractile sheath and ends with a hexagonal baseplate. Six long tail fibers are attached to the baseplate’s periphery and are the host cell’s recognition sensors. The sheath and the baseplate undergo large conformational changes during infection. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have provided structural information on protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions that regulate conformational changes during assembly and infection of Escherichia coli cells.},

Surface hydrolysis was carried out by means of sodium hydroxide solutions, leading to the formation of carboxylate groups. Three commercial polyester films of 100 μm in thickness were used in this work: AryLite™, Mylar™, and Teonex™, hydrolysis time being the main modification parameter. FTIR-ATR analysis, topography and contact angle (CA) measurements, surface free energy (SFE) and T-Peel adhesion tests were carried out to characterize the modified films. A quantitative estimate of the carboxylates surface coverage as a function of treatment time was obtained through a supramolecular approach, i.e. the ionic self-assembly of a tetracationic porphyrin chromophore onto the film surface. The surface free energy and critical surface tension of the hydrolyzed polyesters was evaluated by means of Zisman, Saito, Berthelot and Owens-Wendt methods. It was shown that NaOH solution treatment increases roughness, polarity and surface free energy of polymers. As a result, T-Peel strengths for modified Mylar™ and Teonex™ films were respectively 2.2 and 1.8 times higher than that for the unmodified films, whereas AryLite™ adhesion test failed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests. Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible. In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses. Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus. By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection. In contrast to in vitro examinations, the results of these tests allow use recommendations of chemical disinfectants for outbreak situations and daily routine disinfection.},

  abstract = {Infectious diseases caused by enveloped viruses, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year. Studies have found a relationship among temperature, humidity, and influenza virus incidence, transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity. Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets. Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high ({$>$}85\%) and low ({$<$}60\%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (∼60 to 85\%). At an AH of less than 22 g · m-3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g · m-3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude. At a fixed RH of 75\%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19°C and 25°C. We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity. The model explained 83\% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets. This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets.IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses are responsible for a number of infectious diseases resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year in the United States. There has been a lively debate in the literature over whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) modulates virus infectivity. We designed a controlled study and used advanced statistical modeling techniques specifically to address this question. By providing an improved understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and virus infectivity, our work will ultimately lead to improved strategies for predicting and controlling disease transmission.},

It was the intent of this study to determine whether HTST pasteurization conducted in a continuous-flow pasteurizer that simulates commercial operation would enhance FMDV inactivation in milk. Cows were inoculated in the mammary gland with the field strain of FMDV (01/UK). Infected raw whole milk and 2\% milk were then pasteurized using an Arm-field pilot-scale, continuous-flow HTST pasteurizer equipped with a plate-and-frame heat exchanger and a holding tube. The milk samples, containing FMDV at levels of up to 104 plaque-forming units/mL, were pasteurized at temperatures ranging from 72 to 95°C at holding times of either 18.6 or 36s. Pasteurization decreased virus infectivity by 4 log10 to undetectable levels in tissue culture. However, residual infectivity was still detectable for selected pasteurized milk samples, as shown by intramuscular and intradermal inoculation of milk into naïve steers. Although HTST pasteurization did not completely inactivate viral infectivity in whole and 2\% milk, possibly because a fraction of the virus was protected by the milk fat and the casein proteins, it greatly reduced the risk of natural transmission of FMDV by milk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Choosing the correct surgical staple height is dependent on knowledge of specific tissue thickness and compressibility. The purpose of this study was to measure the thickness of cadaveric human lung tissue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2012 and February 2013, whole lungs were procured from 12 donors. Inclusion criteria included negative serology, no prior thoracic surgery, and completion of measurements within 72 hours of death. Tissue thickness was measured in the anterior-to-posterior direction using a tissue measuring device (TMD) at 41 lung locations. The tissue measuring device applied a constant pressure (8 g/mm2) via a plunger for 15 seconds before reading the thickness.
RESULTS: Cadaveric lung tissue thickness displayed a large variation by location and within each location. Mean thickness in the anterior-to-posterior direction ranged from 1.5 mm (right middle lobe [inferior peripheral] location) to 9.0 mm (right inferior lobe [mid-central] location). In general, the periphery of the lung lobes was thinner than the central locations (e.g., mean peripheral location thickness: 4.1 mm; mean central location thickness: 5.9 mm). The thinnest tissues among the 12 donor cadaveric lung specimens were found in the one donor with a history of severe emphysema/chronic bronchitis. Height (P = 0.012) and weight (P = 0.036) were positively correlated with tissue thickness. Additionally, after adjusting for height, cadaveric lung tissue was 3.0 mm thicker for females than males.
CONCLUSIONS: Large variations of lung tissue thickness were demonstrated throughout the lung as well as within each measured location across different cadaveric specimens. Generally, peripheral locations were thinner than the central locations of the lobes. There was a strong positive correlation between thickness and height, and females had slightly thicker lung tissue than males of the same height.},

  abstract = {The facultative anaerobic bacterium Escherichia coli is frequently forced to adapt to changing environmental conditions. One important determinant for metabolism is the availability of oxygen allowing a more efficient metabolism. Especially in large scale bioreactors, the distribution of oxygen is inhomogeneous and individual cells encounter frequent changes. This might contribute to observed yield losses during process upscaling. Short-term gene expression data exist of an anaerobic E. coli batch culture shifting to aerobic conditions. The data reveal temporary upregulation of genes that are less efficient in terms of energy conservation than the genes predicted by conventional flux balance analyses. In this study, we provide evidence for a positive correlation between metabolic fluxes and gene expression. We then hypothesize that the more efficient enzymes are limited by their low expression, restricting flux through their reactions. We define a demand that triggers expression of the demanded enzymes that we explicitly include in our model. With these features we propose a method, demand-directed dynamic flux balance analysis, dddFBA, bringing together elements of several previously published methods. The introduction of additional flux constraints proportional to gene expression provoke a temporary demand for less efficient enzymes, which is in agreement with the transient upregulation of these genes observed in the data. In the proposed approach, the applied objective function of growth rate maximization together with the introduced constraints triggers expression of metabolically less efficient genes. This finding is one possible explanation for the yield losses observed in large scale bacterial cultivations where steady oxygen supply cannot be warranted.},

  abstract = {Respiratory tract infections can be caused by a wide variety of viruses. Airborne transmission via droplets and aerosols enables some of these viruses to spread efficiently among humans, causing outbreaks that are difficult to control. Many outbreaks have been investigated retrospectively to study the possible routes of inter-human virus transmission. The results of these studies are often inconclusive and at the same time data from controlled experiments is sparse. Therefore, fundamental knowledge on transmission routes that could be used to improve intervention strategies is still missing. We here present an overview of the available data from experimental and observational studies on the transmission routes of respiratory viruses between humans, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss how the available knowledge is currently implemented in isolation guidelines in health care settings.},

The passband-width tunability is achieved by placing variable coupling reducers between the filter resonators. The coupling reducers, operating as bandwidth control subnetworks, are designed as detuned resonators made up of a line segment ending in a variable capacitor. The proposed filter structure is experimentally validated with the design, construction in suspended stripline technology, and characterization of a low-cost filter prototype for terrestrial digital video broadcasting receivers operating in the UHF band (470–862 MHz). Other relevant factors, such as the intermodulation distortion produced by the varactors used to control the bandwidth electronically or the power-handling performance of the constructed filter, are also discussed. The reconfigurable filter module described in this paper is very suitable for the design of flexible multifunction receiver subsystems simultaneously supporting signals with a different bandwidth.},

  abstract = {Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors are widely used for determining liquid properties or probing interfacial processes. For some applications the sensitivity of the QCM sensors typically used (5–20 MHz) is limited compared with other biosensor methods. In this study ultrasensitive QCM sensors with resonant frequencies from 39 to 110 MHz for measurements in the liquid phase are presented. The fundamental sensor effect of a QCM is the decrease of the resonant frequency of an oscillating quartz crystal due to the binding of mass on a coated surface during the measurement. The sensitivity of QCM sensors increases strongly with an increasing resonant frequency and, therefore, with a decreasing thickness of the sensitive area. The new kind of ultrasensitive QCM sensors used in this study is based on chemically milled shear mode quartz crystals which are etched only in the center of the blank, forming a thin quartz membrane with a thick, mechanically stable outer ring. An immunoassay using a virus specific monoclonal antibody and a M13-Phage showed an increase in the signal to noise ratio by a factor of more than 6 for 56 MHz quartz crystals compared with standard 19 MHz quartz crystals, the detection limit was improved by a factor of 200. Probing of acoustic properties of glycerol/water mixtures resulted in an increase in sensitivity, which is in very good agreement with theory. Chemically milled QCM sensors strongly improve the sensitivity in biosensing and probing of acoustic properties and, therefore, offer interesting new application fields for QCM sensors.},

The measured results demonstrated the UWB properties from 3.0GHz to 10.63GHz (-10 dB bandwidth) and the potential to be wider. An three-section filter shown insertion loss at central frequency is about 0.32dB and very flat over the whole band. The group delay, which is important to an impulse radio UWB system, is about 0.42 ns over the most central band, and less than 0.95 ns over the whole band. The filter also exhibited a good performance outside the band, both at low frequency end (to meet FCC limit) and high frequency end higher than 18GHz with insertion loss larger than 30 dB.},

The complete tuning circuit is simulated and presented in this paper along with its tuned frequency-response using the integration of microstrip technology and lumped elements on FR4 substrate. The final tunable stub resonator achieved 66\% tuning range.},

The natural frequencies of such resonances will, generally, be in the microwave frequency range. Some of these systems will be coupled to the electromagnetic field by the charge distributions they carry, thus admitting the possibility that microwave exposures may generate physiological effects in man and other species. However, such microwave excitable resonances are expected to be strongly damped by interaction with their aqueous biological environment. Although those dissipation mechanisms have been studied, the limitations on energy transfers that follow from the limited coupling of these resonances to the electromagnetic field have not generally been considered. We show that this coupling must generally be very small and thus the absorbed energy is so strongly limited that such resonances cannot affect biology significantly even if the systems are much less strongly damped than expected from basic dissipation models.},

To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. The morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the S protein of SARSCoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated. This state revealed by cryo-EM first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.},

  abstract = {Alcohol-based disinfectants play an important role in the prevention of healthcare-acquired infection (HAI). We investigated whether pathogens present in mucus acquire resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants, and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Both the resistance of influenza A virus and Escherichia coli to alcohol-based disinfectants or ultraviolet irradiation and the diffusion rate of ethanol were determined in artificial mucus or sputum samples obtained from 27 individuals with acute upper respiratory infection. Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate {$>$}10\%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient {$>$}0.7, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P\,{$<$}\,0.001 for all). In contrast, complete inactivation was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation independently of mucus viscosity. Thus, mucus viscosity contributes to resistance of pathogens to alcohol-based disinfectants by decreasing the alcohol diffusion rate. These findings can provide a basis for developing new strategies, including improved disinfectants, for overcoming HAI.},

The Wilkinson design can also be used as a power combiner because it is made up of passive components and hence reciprocal. First published by Ernest J. Wilkinson in 1960, this circuit finds wide use in radio frequency communication systems utilizing multiple channels since the high degree of isolation between the output ports prevents crosstalk between the individual channels.
It uses quarter wave transformers, which can be  easily fabricated as quarter wave lines on printed circuit boards. It is also possible to use other forms of transmission line (e.g. coaxial cable) or lumped circuit elements (inductors and capacitors).},

  abstract = {In May 2011 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluated cancer risks from radiofrequency (RF) radiation. Human epidemiological studies gave evidence of increased risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma. RF radiation was classified as Group 2B, a possible human carcinogen. Further epidemiological, animal and mechanistic studies have strengthened the association. In spite of this, in most countries little or nothing has been done to reduce exposure and educate people on health hazards from RF radiation. On the contrary ambient levels have increased. In 2014 the WHO launched a draft of a Monograph on RF fields and health for public comments. It turned out that five of the six members of the Core Group in charge of the draft are affiliated with International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an industry loyal NGO, and thus have a serious conflict of interest. Just as by ICNIRP, evaluation of non-thermal biological effects from RF radiation are dismissed as scientific evidence of adverse health effects in the Monograph. This has provoked many comments sent to the WHO. However, at a meeting on March 3, 2017 at the WHO Geneva office it was stated that the WHO has no intention to change the Core Group.},

  abstract = {The d.c. electrical conductivity and optical properties of undoped zinc oxide films prepared by the sol-gel process using a spin-coating technique were investigated. The ZnO films were obtained by 10 cycle spin-coated and dried zinc acetate films followed by annealing in air at 500–575°C. The films deposited on the Pyrex glass substrate were polycrystalline and c-axis oriented. A minimum film resistivity gave 28.2 Ω cm at an annealing temperature of 525°C. The temperature dependence of the conductivity indicated electron transport in the conduction band due to thermal excitation of donor electrons for temperatures from 250 to 300 K. The grain boundary scattering effect due to thermionic emission was confirmed. For temperatures below 250 K nearest-neighbor hopping conduction was dominant in the films. The films were transparent in the visible range above 400 nm and had sharp ultraviolet absorption edges at 380 nm. The absorption edge analysis revealed that the optical band gap energy for the films was 3.20–3.21 eV and the electronic transition was of the direct transition type. From the Urbach tail analysis the width of the localized state Ee=0.07–0.08 eV.},
