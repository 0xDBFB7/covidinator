Coherent radiation from the array was obtained at 10.23 GHz by feeding only the center element with an injectionlocking signal, which then appeared at the input to the other two elements by free space mutual coupling. The three IMPATTs injection locked successfully in this manner. A beamwidth of 38 degrees and sidelobe level of -10 dB were achieved, values consistent with the theory for coherent radiation from an array of this configuration. An RF efficiency of 90\% and a bandwidth of 30 MHz were measured.},

It is analytically and experimentally proved that dual-arm modulation with in-phase sinusoidal signals having slightly different amplitudes generated a highly coherent optical comb with a great spectral flatness and a parabolic phase relationship in its spectrum. The generated comb was Fourier synthesized and shaped into an ultrashort pulse train with an optical bandpass filter and a dispersive fiber. The pulse source was highly stable, exhibiting an ultralow timing jitter of less than 130 fs.},

  abstract = {A Random Equivalent Sampling (RES) circuit that has 16ps sampling resolution has been developed for a high-resolution Time-Domain Reflectometer (TDR). The high-resolution TDR uses an expensive programmable delay chip or a complex Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) circuit to capture the waveform with very fine time interval. The Vernier time delay generation technique using two crystal oscillators of slightly different frequency is proposed, which is simpler and more cost-effective and provides subpicosecond time resolution. One of the two clocks is used for the reference time to generate incident periodic pulses, and another clock is used for the sampling, The implemented RES circuit consists of the Vernier clock generator, the pulse generator and the control logic for pulse generation, interface and high-speed memory control. Using the ADC of relatively low sampling rate, the periodic pulse waveform is reconstructed with tens of GSPS high equivalent sampling rate by the repetitive sampling utilizing the incremental Vernier time delay. The performance of RES circuit is measured through the operation of TDR. The resolution of the RES circuit is 16.8ps equal to 59.5GSPS sampling rate, which means that the signal waveform in the 66.7\%VOP RG58C/U cable can be sampled by 1.6mm interval.},

The 3-D focusing is conducted to find the optimum excitations (phases and amplitudes) of a 3-D antenna array surrounding the breast using particle swarm optimization. The focusing approach aims at producing the required temperature (42 \textdegree C) at a tumor anywhere in the breast without causing hot spots in healthy tissue. Based on the modeling, a microwave system, which includes a 4.2-GHz source, power amplifier, two-stage power dividers, and phase shifters in addition to 24-element antenna array, was designed, built, and tested. The test was performed on the challenging scenario of a very dense breast phantom having 1-cm3 tumor embedded in glands. The experiments were conducted on a 3-D printed phantom that has realistic dielectric and thermal properties. The breast phantom was irradiated for one hour while the temperature distribution was recorded by thermal imager at different time intervals. The results confirmed the capability of the proposed 3-D focusing technique and experimental system in using 65-W microwave power to elevate the temperature at tumor to more than 42 \textdegree C while keeping healthy tissue safe at 36 \textdegree C without any hot spots.},

  abstract = {Human noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks have suggested that vomiting facilitates transmission of human NoV, but there have been no laboratory-based studies characterizing the degree of NoV release during a vomiting event. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that virus aerosolization occurs in a simulated vomiting event, and to estimate the amount of virus that is released in those aerosols. A simulated vomiting device was constructed at one-quarter scale of the human body following similitude principles. Simulated vomitus matrices at low (6.24 mPa*s) and high (177.5 mPa*s) viscosities were inoculated with low (108 PFU/mL) and high (1010 PFU/mL) concentrations of bacteriophage MS2 and placed in the artificial ``stomach'' of the device, which was then subjected to scaled physiologically relevant pressures associated with vomiting. Bio aerosols were captured using an SKC Biosampler. In low viscosity artificial vomitus, there were notable differences between recovered aerosolized MS2 as a function of pressure (i.e., greater aerosolization with increased pressure), although this was not always statistically significant. This relationship disappeared when using high viscosity simulated vomitus. The amount of MS2 aerosolized as a percent of total virus ``vomited'' ranged from 7.2 x 10-5 to 2.67 x 10-2 (which corresponded to a range of 36 to 13,350 PFU total). To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and measure aerosolization of a NoV surrogate in a similitude-based physical model. This has implications for better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection control measures.},

We find that the chloride ions play a key role in the stability of the capsid. A low number of chloride ions results in loss of the native icosahedral symmetry, while an optimal number of chloride ions create a neutralizing layer next to the positively charged inner surface of the capsid. Understanding the dependence of the capsid stability on the distribution of the ions will help clarify the details of the viral life cycle that is ultimately connected to the role of packaged viral genome inside the capsid.},

These studies directly measure the cell uptake and clearance in cultured cells and animal tissue cells of lac inducers. In these cells, the beta-galactosides, isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and methyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (MTG), are rapidly taken up, exceeding extracellular levels in less than 2 hours. Greater than 5\% of this inducer is found in the nuclear fraction, slightly exceeding the cytoplasmic concentration. Although similar in uptake, IPTG is cleared from the cultured cells significantly faster than MTG. In the mouse, the half-life of both inducers in the blood ranges from 15-30 minutes. HPLC analysis of tissue extracts from inducer-injected mice indicates that the inducer is metabolically stable and functionally able to bind to lac repressor. These results should permit improvement in the adaptation of the lac repressor system to mammalian cells and aid in the development of an adaptable system for gene control in transgenic animals.},

  abstract = {The derivation and application of a method designed to investigate the focusing properties of pulsed baseband signals of short pulsewidth (/spl sim/1 ns) in biological tissue media are reported. To this end, sources fed from TEM waveguides, concentrically placed at the periphery of a three-layer cylindrical lossy model, are assumed. A Fourier-series-based methodology, appropriate for a useful class of pulse train incident signals, is presented and utilized to study the dynamics of pulse propagation inside the tissue medium. The propagation of each spectral component of the incident field within the tissue medium is analyzed by applying an integral-equation technique and a Fourier-series representation is used in order to obtain the time dependence of the electromagnetic fields produced at any point within tissue due to the pulsed excitation of the array elements. Numerical results are computed and presented at several points in a three-layer geometry, 20 cm in diameter, irradiated by an eight-element waveguide array. Focusing at a specific point of interest within tissue is achieved by properly adjusting the time delay of the signals injected to the individual applicators of the array.},

  abstract = {Aims: The application of the AC electrokinetic technique of electrorotation for studying eukaryotic parasite transmission stages is reviewed. Electrorotation is a noninvasive technique that utilizes electrically energized microelectrode structures within micro-fluidic chambers to probe the physiological structure of micro-organisms. Application of the technique to the transmission life cycle stages of three separate genera of protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Cyclospora, and one nematode genus Ascaris, each of significant public health importance, is described. Methods and Results: Standard electrorotation apparatus, consisting of micro-fabricated electrodes in a fluidic chip, quadrature sinusoidal signal generator, microscope and image capture system, was used to study each organism. Spectra of cellular rotation rate were recorded as a function of applied electric field frequency and compared with standardized biological tests, where appropriate, to illustrate the effectiveness and versatility of the electrorotation technique. Conclusions: Electrorotational determination of the viability of individual G. intestinalis cysts, Cryptosporidium parvum and Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts has been achieved. The sporulation state of Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts was also readily determined, as was the fertilization state of A. suum ova. Significance and Impact of the Study: Electrorotation is a simple, noninvasive and versatile analytical technique suited to a wide range of particle types and capable of incorporation into integrated Lab-on-a-chip devices.},

By employing Near Field Focusing more power may be transmitted before the EIRP limit is reached due to the inherent far-field difusing. A design based on four Yagi-Uda array elements is able to produce an average power density of 21.04dBm/m2 at 2.45GHz in a box of 10x10x10cm3 located 1m from the linear array face. The design has been verified through comparison with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. First measurements on a realized prototype confirm the functioning of the array.},

The elemental current moments of array are assumed with a transient impulse input for the excitations whose signals are delayed to radiate near-zone focused fields. The transient field phenomena for each of the Floquet mode expansion were analyzed. The solution reduces to the case of far-zone field radiation by moving the focus point to the far zone. The analysis shows that the radiation exhibits an impulse field at the focused point, and finite pulses at locations away from the focus point. Phenomena of partial cylindrical wave functions have been observed.},

  abstract = {Approximate formulas are derived for the far field and gain of standard, open-ended, rectangular waveguide probes operating within their recommended usable bandwidth. (Such probes are commonly used in making near-field antenna measurements.) The derivation assumes first-order azimuthal dependence for the fields, and anE-plan pattern given by the traditional Stratton-Chu integration of the transverse electric (TE\_10) mode. TheH-plane pattern is estimated by two different methods. The first method uses a purelyE-field integration across the end of the waveguide. The second, more accurate method approximates the fringe currents at the shorter edges of the guide by isotropically radiating line sources. The amplitude of the line sources is determined by equating the total power radiated into free space to the net input power to the waveguide. Comparisons with measurements indicate that forX-band and larger waveguide probes, both methods predict on-axis gain to about 0.2 dB accuracy. The second method predicts far-field power patterns to about 2 dB accuracy in the region90\textbackslash degoff boresight and with rapidly increasing accuracy toward boresight.},

  abstract = {A thickened bronchial wall is the morphological substratum of most diseases of the airway. Theoretical and clinical models of bronchial morphometry have so far focused on bronchial lumen diameter, and bronchial length and angles, mainly assessed from bronchial casts. However, these models do not provide information on bronchial wall thickness. This paper reports in vivo values of cross-sectional wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter in ten healthy subjects as assessed by multi-detector computed tomography. A validated dedicated software package was used to measure these morphometric parameters up to the 14th bronchial generation, with respect to Weibel's model of bronchial morphometry, and up to the 12th according to Boyden's classification. Measured lumen diameters and homothety ratios were compared with theoretical values obtained from previously published studies, and no difference was found when considering dichotomic division of the bronchial tree. Mean wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter were then provided according to bronchial generation order, and mean homothety ratios were computed for wall area, lumen area and wall thickness as well as equations giving the mean value of each parameter for a given bronchial generation with respect to its value in generation 0 (trachea). Multi-detector computed tomography measurements of bronchial morphometric parameters may help to improve our knowledge of bronchial anatomy in vivo, our understanding of the pathophysiology of bronchial diseases and the evaluation of pharmacological effects on the bronchial wall.},

However, steam autoclaves typically used for this purpose may not be readily accessible to everyone in the scientific community, such as K-12 teachers, researchers in the field, students in under-funded laboratories, or persons in the developing world who lack funding and resources. This work examines the use of commercial electric pressure cookers as an alternative method for the sterilization of media, instruments, and waste. Four commonly available brands of pressure cooker were tested for their ability to sterilize microbiological media, a variety of metal instruments, and high-titer microbial cultures. All four pressure cookers were able to sterilize these starting materials as well as a range of microbial types, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, filamentous fungi, unicellular fungi, and mixed environmental samples. Only the Instant Pot, however, was able to sterilize autoclave tester ampoules of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores. These results suggest that, depending on the nature of the work undertaken, store-bought pressure cookers can be an appropriate substitute for commercial autoclaves. Their adoption may also help increase the accessibility of science to a broader range of investigators.},

Optical quality plastic materials with a low autofluorescence are crucial for optimal detection by fluorescence and laser induced fluorescence techniques. This paper summarizes a series of optical investigations on commercially available plastic chip materials (PMMA, COC, PC, PDMS) and chips made from those materials. Intrinsic optical constants of plastic materials-refractive index for bulk materials-determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmission spectroscopy in the visible range are presented. The laser-induced autofluorescence of materials and chips was assessed at four laser wavelengths, namely, 403, 488, 532 and 633 nm. Considerable bleaching of the autofluorescence was observed under continuous laser illumination. Overall, the longer wavelength laser excitation sources yielded less autofluorescence. PDMS exhibited the least autofluorescence and was comparable to BoroFloat glass. In all cases, chips exhibited slightly higher autofluorescence than the raw plastic materials from which they had been made.},

This procedure is commonly done using a 4.5cm catheter, and the optimal site for chest wall puncture is controversial. We hypothesize that needle thoracostomy cannot be performed using this catheter length irrespective of the site chosen in either gender. Methods A retrospective review of all chest computed tomography (CT) scans obtained on trauma patients from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 was performed. Patients aged 18 and 80 years were included and patients whose chest wall thickness exceeded the boundary of the images acquired were excluded. Chest wall thickness was measured at the 2nd intercostal (ICS), midclavicular line (MCL) and the 5th ICS, anterior axillary line (AAL). Injury severity score (ISS), chest wall thickness, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed. Results 201 patients were included, 54\% male. Average (SD) BMI was 26 (7)kg/m2. The average chest wall thickness in the overall cohort was 4.08 (1.4)cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 4.55 (1.7)cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. 29\% of the overall cohort (27 male and 32 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 45\% (54 male and 36 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. There was no significant interaction between gender and chest wall thickness at either site. BMI was positively associated with chest wall thickness at both the 2nd and 5th ICS/AAL. Conclusion A 4.5cm catheter is inadequate for needle thoracostomy in most patients regardless of puncture site or gender.},

This article describes a novel electrode-integrated printed-circuit-board (PCB)-based C4D device, which supports the simple and safe exchange of capillaries and improves the sensitivity and repeatability of the contactless detection. Furthermore, no syringe pump is needed in the detection, it reduces the system size, and, more importantly, avoids the effect on the bacteria due to high pressure. The recovered bacteria after C4D detection at excitation of 25 Vpp and 60\&ndash;120 kHz were analyzed by flow cytometry, and a survival rate higher than 96\% was given. It was verified that C4D detection did not influence the bacterial viability. Moreover, bacteria concentrations from 106 cells/mL to 108 cells/mL were measured in a linear range, and relative standard deviation (RSD) is below 0.2\%.

  abstract = {Mature particles of bacteriophage lambda are composed of about equal amounts of protein and DNA. Each phage contains one double-stranded DNA molecule encapsulated in an icosahedral head, which is about 50 nm (0.05 {$\mu$}) in diameter; a flexible tubular tail, which is about 150 nm (0.15 {$\mu$}) long and terminates in a fiber, projects from the head (Kellenberger and Edgar, 1971). Lambda is an obligatory parasite of Escherichia coli. Growth begins when a phage particle attaches to the host by the tip of its tail and injects its DNA molecule. Lambda is a temperate phage and, thus, can multiply in E. coli by one of three ways: (1) In productive growth, the injected DNA molecule directs the synthesis of numerous gene products; these promote replication of the phage DNA, synthesis of the phage heads and tails, packaging of the DNA into mature phage particles, and eventual lysis of the cell. At 37\textdegree C it takes about 40 minutes for a lytic cycle, and about 100 infective progeny phage are produced. (2) Lambda DNA can also persist in the host cell as a prophage and replicate passively as an integral part of the bacterial genome. In this case the injected DNA must first direct the synthesis of the gene products that promote its linear insertion into the genome of the host. Next, it turns on the synthesis of the repressor, which blocks transcription of those genes responsible for autonomous lambda DNA replication and most other phage functions.},

The measured Young's modulus ({$\approx$}1.8 GPa) is comparable with that of hard plastic. We also observe fatigue and breakage of capsids after probing them repetitively.

  abstract = {Virtually all studies of phage infections investigate bacteria growing exponentially in rich media. In nature, however, phages largely encounter non-growing cells. Bacteria entering stationary phase often activate well-studied stress defense mechanisms that drastically alter the cell, facilitating its long-term survival. An understanding of phage-host interactions in such conditions is of major importance from both an ecological and therapeutic standpoint. Here, we show that bacteriophage T4 can efficiently bind to, infect and kill E. coli in stationary phase, both in the presence and absence of a functional stationary-phase sigma factor, and explore the response of T4-infected stationary phase cells to the addition of fresh nutrients 5 or 24 hours after that infection. An unexpected new mode of response has been identified. ``Hibernation'' mode is a persistent but reversible dormant state in which the infected cells make at least some phage enzymes, but halt phage development until appropriate nutrients become available before producing phage particles. Our evidence indicates that the block in hibernation mode occurs after the middle-mode stage of phage development; host DNA breakdown and the incorporation of the released nucleotides into phage DNA indicate that the enzymes of the nucleotide synthesizing complex, under middle-mode control, have been made and assembled into a functional state. Once fresh glucose and amino acids become available, the standard lytic infection process rapidly resumes and concentrations of up to 1011 progeny phage (an average of about 40 phage per initially-present cell) are produced. All evidence is consistent with the hibernation-mode control point lying between middle mode and late mode T4 gene expression. We have also observed a ``scavenger'' response, where the infecting phage takes advantage of whatever few nutrients are available to produce small quantities of progeny within 2 to 5 hours after infection. The scavenger response seems able to produce no more than an average of one phage per originally-available cell, and few if any further progeny are produced by cells in this mode even if fresh nutrients are made available later.},

This required focusing time delay has been modified from the current formulation to incorporate either an odd or even number of elements. A brief procedure leading to the derivation of the pressure distribution for beam focusing is described, which gives rise to an unclosed form. Consequently, a numerical method is desirable for the analysis of beam focusing. Using this approach, beam directivity and pressure distributions are studied to predict the behavior of focusing as compared to steering. This shows a benefit of focusing over steering within the near field of the array, and that the directivity of focusing converges to that of steering in the far field.},

We have applied methods primarily based on atomic force microscopy and finite element modeling that allow precise investigation of the mechanical properties of the influenza virus lipid envelope. The mechanical properties of small, spherical vesicles made from PR8 influenza lipids were probed by an atomic force microscopy tip applying forces up to 0.2 nN, which led to an elastic deformation up to 20\%, on average. The liposome deformation was modeled using finite element methods to extract the lipid bilayer elastic properties. We found that influenza liposomes were softer than what would be expected for a gel phase bilayer and highly deformable: Consistent with previous suggestion that influenza lipids do not undergo a major phase transition, we observe that the stiffness of influenza liposomes increases gradually and weakly (within one order of magnitude) with temperature. Surprisingly, influenza liposomes were, in most cases, able to withstand wall-to-wall deformation, and forces {$>$}1 nN were generally required to puncture the influenza envelope, which is similar to viral protein shells. Hence, the choice of a highly flexible lipid envelope may provide as efficient a protection for a viral genome as a stiff protein shell.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the biological effects of microwaves. It is emphasized that an appropriate discussion of the experimental results with regard to nonthermal effects must frequently consider thermal effects as well. The amount of energy transfer from the radiation to the material varies slowly with frequency and is largely governed by the dielectric loss. Within reasonable limits, this loss is proportional to the intensity of the radiation. Nonthermal effects, on the other hand, occur in certain frequency regions only, and usually exhibit saturation at rather low intensity. As a consequence, nonthermal effects might be drowned by the thermal ones. This is in particular to be expected when the sign of the considered effect in the nonthermal region is opposite to that of the thermal effect. As an example, consider the reduction of the rate of growth of certain bacteria arising from irradiation at 73.6 Hz as discussed. Temperature increase, on the other hand, increases the rate of growth, thus canceling the nonthermal effect at sufficiently high intensity.},

  abstract = {A bioluminescence-based assay for enumeration of lytic bacteriophage was developed. The assay consists of a bioluminescent Escherichia coli as the host bacterium, the lytic bacteriophage T4 and an automated luminometer measuring luminescence over time. The assay is based on the decrease in luminescence as the bioluminescent host cells are lysed by T4. The T4 concentration, bioluminescent E. coli concentration, phage suspension medium, and temperature (25\textdegree C and 37\textdegree C) were varied. There was a strong negative correlation between bioluminescence intensities and T4 phage concentrations at both room temperature (R2=0.993) and 37\textdegree C (R2=0.970). Phage was detected more rapidly at 37\textdegree C than at 25\textdegree C. The detection limit was also lower when the assay was performed at 37\textdegree C with a minimum detection level of 2.4 log CFU/ml compared to 3.4 log CFU/ml for 25\textdegree C. The assay was used to determine thermal inactivation using T4 phages heated at 70\textdegree C for 0 to 30min, and phage concentrations were determined using the bioluminescence assay and a standard plaque assay. There was no significant difference between the two enumeration methods (P{$>$}0.01). This study suggests the bioluminescence-based assay can be used as an alternative for quantitatively monitoring phage infectivity, instead of conventional standard plaque assays.},

  abstract = {One of the most popular methods to fabricate biomedical microfluidic devices is by using a soft-lithography technique. However, the fabrication of the moulds to produce microfluidic devices, such as SU-8 moulds, usually requires a cleanroom environment that can be quite costly. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop low-cost alternatives for the fabrication of microstructures, avoiding the use of cleanroom facilities. Recently, low-cost techniques without cleanroom facilities that feature aspect ratios more than 20, for fabricating those SU-8 moulds have been gaining popularity among biomedical research community. In those techniques, Ultraviolet (UV) exposure equipment, commonly used in the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) industry, replaces the more expensive and less available Mask Aligner that has been used in the last 15 years for SU-8 patterning. Alternatively, non-lithographic low-cost techniques, due to their ability for large-scale production, have increased the interest of the industrial and research community to develop simple, rapid and low-cost microfluidic structures. These alternative techniques include Print and Peel methods (PAP), laserjet, solid ink, cutting plotters or micromilling, that use equipment available in almost all laboratories and offices. An example is the xurography technique that uses a cutting plotter machine and adhesive vinyl films to generate the master moulds to fabricate microfluidic channels. In this review, we present a selection of the most recent lithographic and non-lithographic low-cost techniques to fabricate microfluidic structures, focused on the features and limitations of each technique. Only microfabrication methods that do not require the use of cleanrooms are considered. Additionally, potential applications of these microfluidic devices in biomedical engineering are presented with some illustrative examples.},

Until now, no commercially available systems enabled the automated handling of both types of cells in one system. In particular, the automated cultivation of suspension cells in this form has not been published. The cell counts and viabilities were nonsignificantly decreased for cells cultivated in AutoFlasks in automated handling. The proliferation of manual and automated bioscreening by the WST-1 assay showed a nonsignificant lower proliferation of automatically disseminated cells associated with a mostly lower standard error. The disseminated suspension cell lines showed different pronounced proliferations in descending order, starting with Jurkat cells followed by SEM, Molt4, and RS4 cells having the lowest proliferation. In this respect, we successfully disseminated and screened suspension cells in an automated way. The automated cultivation and dissemination of a variety of suspension cells can replace the manual method.},

While significant research activity has been directed towards the formation of microfluidic components in a wide range of thermoplastics, sealing of these components is required for the formation of enclosed microchannels and other microfluidic elements, and thus bonding remains a critical step in any thermoplastic microfabrication process. Unlike silicon and glass, the diverse material properties of thermoplastics opens the door to an extensive array of substrate bonding options, together with a set of unique challenges which must be addressed to achieve optimal sealing results. In this paper we review the range of techniques developed for sealing thermoplastic microfluidics and discuss a number of practical issues surrounding these various bonding methods.},

  abstract = {We have developed an integrated microfluidic-microelectronic measurement platform in order to accurately measure the dielectric properties of sub-muL volumes of liquids at frequencies up to 40 GHz. We use on-wafer calibration techniques to obtain accurate S-parameter measurements of fluids and biological samples in solution contained within microfluidic structures directly integrated with patterned coplanar waveguide transmission lines. Our analysis yields the capacitance and conductance per unit length of our fluid-loaded transmission lines, and finite element simulations yield the relative permittivity as a continuous function of frequency up to 40 GHz. We demonstrate the technique with measurements of the complex permittivity of de-ionized water and methanol. Results for the frequency-dependent permittivity obtained in our microfluidic test structures show good agreement with bulk fluid measurements over a comparable frequency range. We expect this technique to be useful for rapid electromagnetic characterization of sub-microliter volumes of both liquids and biological samples in solution},

  abstract = {A new microstrip fed low profile broadband dielectric resonator antenna is proposed. The antenna is composed of a dielectric resonator, a microstrip fed stepped patch and an intermediate substrate. The stepped patch and the intermediate substrate allow to widen the matching bandwidth. Using a finite integration method (CST Microwave), a parametric investigation was performed for the optimization. To validate our analysis, a prototype of the optimized antenna was fabricated and measured. The predicted results are computed with measured data and good agreement is reported. With the proposed antenna, a fractional bandwidth of 50\% around the center frequency 10 GHz is achieved, and relatively stable radiation patterns are obtained in the matching band.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus first appeared in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China where it leaped from animals to people. Facilitated by global travel, SARS spread from person-to-person from China to other countries including Singapore. SARS was first discovered in Singapore in 3 patients who had recently traveled to Hong Kong. From then on, SARS outbreak in Singapore was exemplified by nosocomial transmission. SARS is a viral respiratory illness caused by SARS-associated coronavirus with transmission via droplet spread after inhalation of respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Aerosol generating procedures such as intubation and bronchoscopy may increase the risk of transmission, through aerosolization of virus containing particles. During the epidemic, all elective bronchoscopies were subject to an audit of indications and were performed in well-ventilated rooms, with negative air pressure relative to the hallways, and with the endoscopist and assistants wearing full personal protective equipment and positive air purifying respirator. In our institution, the bronchoscope together with accessory equipment were washed and cleaned with an enzymatic cleaner promptly postprocedure before immersing in Cidex OPA for disinfection. A new set of personal protective equipment was donned for this cleaning and disinfecting procedure. Our average preuse and postbronchoscopy disinfection time was approximately 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. A complete log of persons performing the disinfection, physicians performing bronchoscopies, and healthcare workers who assisted them was kept. Also, the duration of disinfection, date, time, patient particulars, and indications for bronchoscopy was recorded for each bronchoscopy performed. The experience with SARS has reminded us of the need for proper respiratory protection when attending to patients with respiratory infection and has shown us that with precautions, nosocomial transmission to the healthcare workers can be prevented.},

Normally gel imaging systems cost at least 8-12 thousand dollars, but there's no reason to spend that sort of cash. With nothing but a simple wooden box, and filter you can make your own gel doc for less than 100 dollars.

  abstract = {Capsid integrity quantitative PCR (qPCR), a molecular detection method for infectious viruses combining azo dye pretreatment with qPCR, has been widely used in recent years; however, variations in pretreatment conditions for various virus types can limit the efficacy of specific protocols. By identifying and critically synthesizing 42 recent peer-reviewed studies employing capsid integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its derivates between 10 and 200 uM; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 to 25C) for 5 to 120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 to 800 Watts) exposure for periods ranging from 5 to 20 min. These simple steps can benefit the investigation of infectious virus transmission in routine (water) monitoring settings and during viral outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 pandemic or endemic diseases like dengue fever.},

  abstract = {When particles of phage T2 are subjected to osmotic shock and the resulting solution is digested with deoxyribonuclease and centrifuged for 5 hours at 93,000g, the supernatant fraction contains 7\% of the acid-insoluble sulfur (or about 7\% of the total protein) of the particles. The protein fraction (``internal protein'') separated in this way is virtually free from phage coat protein, contains all the internal antigen of the particles, and small amounts of at least one other protein. In solutions prepared by submitting phage particles to osmotic shock but without enzymatic treatment, the internal protein associates reversibly with the nucleic acid at low salt concentrations. It dissociates almost completely at NaCl concentrations greater than 0.1M, at MgCl2 concentrations greater than 0.01M, or at pH greater than 10. In infected bacteria, protein accumulates that is a precursor of the internal protein of phage particles and can be assayed as such by radiochemical methods. Measured in this way, synthesis of internal protein begins promptly after infection, reaches a maximum rate after about 10 minutes, and falls to a somewhat lower rate thereafter. The rate of synthesis is about equal to the rate of incorporation into phage particles after these start to form. The precursor pools contain about 54 phage-equivalent units of internal protein, as compared to 28 units of phage coat protein and 45 units of nucleic acid. Synthesis of internal protein is stopped by addition of chloramphenicol to the culture under conditions that permit continued synthesis of nucleic acid. The rate of incorporation of labeled, early-synthesized internal protein into phage particles is independent of the amount of phage-precursor nucleic acid in the cells when the latter is varied by appropriate chloramphenicol treatment. This is true even when the amount of precursor nucleic acid exceeds the equivalent amount of precursor internal protein, and it shows that if internal protein makes any persistent attachment to phage nucleic acid inside bacteria, it does so at the time of maturation of phage particles, not at the time of synthesis of nucleic acid. Labeled internal protein of the infecting phage particles does not reappear as internal protein in the offspring phage particles.},

We have examined the proteins of a large number of representative eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses for the occurrence of significant clusters, runs, and periodic patterns of charge. Clusters and runs of positive charge are prominent in many capsid and core proteins, whereas surface (glyco)proteins frequently contain a negative charge cluster. Significant charge configurations are abundant in regulatory proteins implicated in transcriptional transactivation and cellular transformation. Proteins with charge structures are much more predominant in animal DNA viruses as compared to animal RNA viruses and prokaryotic viruses. This contrast might reflect the role of protein charge structures in facilitating competitive virus-host interactions involving the cellular transcription, translation, protein sorting, and transport apparatus.},

The conformational ensembles of IDPs are encoded by their amino acid sequences. Here, we present two computational tools that are designed to enable rapid and high-throughput analyses of a wide range of physicochemical properties encoded by IDP sequences. The first, CIDER, is a user-friendly webserver that enables rapid analysis of IDP sequences. The second, localCIDER, is a high-performance software package that enables a wide range of analyses relevant to IDP sequences. In addition to introducing the two packages, we demonstrate the utility of these resources using examples where sequence analysis offers biophysical insights.},

  abstract = {In the coarse grained Brownian Dynamics simulation method the many solvent molecules are replaced by random thermal kicks and an effective friction acting on the particles of interest. For Brownian Dynamics the friction has to be so strong that the particles' velocities are damped much faster than the duration of an integration timestep. Here we show that this conceptual limit can be dropped with an analytic integration of the equations of damped motion. In the resulting Langevin integration scheme our recently proposed approximate form of the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles can be incorparated conveniently, leading to a fast multi-particle propagation scheme, which captures more of the short-time and short-range solvent effects than standard BD. Comparing the dynamics of a bead-spring model of a short peptide, we recommend to run simulations of small biological molecules with the Langevin type finite damping and to include the hydrodynamic interactions.},

  abstract = {[spa] Los virus son entidades biol\'ogicas relativamente simples, pero muy eficientes. En su forma m\'as simple est\'an constituidos por una cadena de material gen\'etico protegida por una cubierta de prote\'inas llamada c\'apside, cuya formaci\'on y propiedades juegan un papel crucial en el ciclo vital de los virus. Un mayor conocimiento de la f\'isica que se esconde tras los virus permitir\'ia no s\'olo combatirlos, sino tambi\'en usarlos para aplicaciones \'utiles en disciplinas como la medicina, nanociencia o farmacia. En esta tesis nos hemos centrado en la caracterizaci\'on f\'isica de las propiedades mec\'anicas y el autoensamblaje de la c\'apsida de virus esf\'ericos con simetr\'ia icosa\'edrica. Para ello hemos propuesto un modelo de grano-grueso basado en un potencial de interacci\'on sencillo entre las subunidades estructurales de la c\'apsida. Los par\'ametros del modelo est\'an directamente relacionados con propiedades f\'isicamente relevantes y que pueden ser medibles experimentalmente, como son la curvatura espont\'anea de la c\'apside y la constante el\'astica de flexi\'on. Estos dos ingredientes son cruciales para determinar la arquitectura y el tama\~no de los virus. Con este nuevo modelo, hemos hecho simulaciones usando diferentes t\'ecnicas para reproducir y estudiar experimentos de auto-ensamblaje. En particular, hemos analizado el rango de par\'ametros y las condiciones adecuadas que determinan la forma y la estabilidad de las distintas estructuras de los virus. Tambi\'en hemos analizado la cin\'etica de autoensamblaje y los pasos intermedios de la formaci\'on de virus, inaccesibles experimentalmente por las caracter\'isticas del proceso. Adem\'as hemos determinado la importancia de la geometr\'ia y m\'as concretamente del n\'umero de triangulaci\'on y la clase en la respuesta mec\'anica y en la tendencia a cambiar de forma durante el proceso de maduraci\'on. Este cambio de forma conlleva una mayor rigidez y tolerancia a la presi\'on, que puede aportar ventajas biol\'ogicas especialmente en virus de ADN de doble cadena. Finalmente, hemos desarrollado modelos de elementos finitos y simulaciones discretas para interpretar experimentos de nanoindentaci\'on con AFM. Con ellos hemos estudiado la ruptura y la dureza de la c\'apside del bacteri\'ofago T7 orientada seg\'un los diferentes ejes de simetr\'ia icosa\'edrica, y desarrollado un m\'etodo para determinar la presi\'on interna en el bacteri\'ofago phi29.},

  abstract = {Exploring recent developments in the field, Coarse-Graining of Condensed Phase and Biomolecular Systems examines systematic ways of constructing coarse-grained representations for complex systems. It explains how this approach can be used in the simulation and modeling of condensed phase and biomolecular systems. Each chapter focuses on specific examples of evolving coarse-graining methodologies and presents results for a variety of complex systems. The contributors carefully detail their own coarse-graining approach, exploring its motivation, strengths, weaknesses, and important application examples. They discuss two of the most successful coarse-graining schemes for soft matter: inverse and multiscale coarse-graining. The book also describes current coarse-grained model development for peptides and proteins at the amino acid level and larger length scales. Assembling the work of some of the most influential, world-renowned researchers in the field, this book provides a unified, in-depth overview of all the coarse-grained schemes developed for condensed phase and biomolecular systems. It shows the promise of coarse-graining as a revolutionary advancement in the scientific community.},

  abstract = {Foodborne pathogens are a major public health threat and financial burden for the food industry, individuals, and society, with an estimated 76 million cases of food-related illness occurring in the United States alone each year. Three of the most important causative bacterial agents of foodborne diseases are pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes, due to the severity and frequency of illness and disproportionally high number of fatalities. Their continued persistence in food has dictated the ongoing need for faster, simpler, and less expensive analytical systems capable of live pathogen detection in complex samples. Culture techniques for detection and identification of foodborne pathogens require 5-7 days to complete. Major improvements to molecular detection techniques have been introduced recently, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These methods can be tedious; require complex, expensive instrumentation; necessitate highly trained personnel; and are not easily amenable to routine screening. Here, a paper-based analytical device ({$\mu$}PAD) has been developed for the detection of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes in food samples as a screening system. In this work, a paper-based microspot assay was created by use of wax printing on filter paper. Detection is achieved by measuring the color change when an enzyme associated with the pathogen of interest reacts with a chromogenic substrate. When combined with enrichment procedures, the method allows for an enrichment time of 12 h or less and is capable of detecting bacteria in concentrations in inoculated readyto-eat (RTE) meat as low as 101 colony-forming units/cm2.},

We show surface-induced correlations, excluded volume, and electrostatic forces are sufficient to predict most of the major features of the current structural data for DNA packaged within viral capsids without additional ordering due to elastic bending forces for the polymer. Current models assume highly-ordered, even spooled, hexagonally packed conformations based on interpretation of cryo-EM density maps. We show herein that the surface induced packing of short (6mer), unconnected DNA polymer segments is the only necessary ingredient in creating ringed densities consistent with experimental density maps. This implies the ensemble of possible conformations of polymeric DNA within the capsid that are consistent with cryo-EM data may be much larger than implied by traditional interpretations where such rings can only result from highly-ordered spool-like conformations. This opens the possibility of a more disordered, entropically-driven view of phage packaging thermodynamics. We also show the electrostatics of the DNA contributes a large portion of the internal hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of a phage virion, suggesting that nonlinear elastic anomalies might reduce the overall elastic bending enthalpy of more disordered conformations to have allowable free energies.},

  abstract = {A comparison has been made of seven numerical methods of fitting infrared absorption band envelopes with analytical functions using nonlinear least squares approximations. Gauss and Cauchy (Lorentz) band shape functions are used, and also sum and product combinations of the two. The methods have been compared with respect to both the degree of convergence and to the computation time needed to achieve an acceptable fit.The most effective method has matched the overlap envelope of a steroid spectrum containing 16 bands; this necessitated the optimization of 65 variables. More complex spectra can be dealt with by a "moving subspace" modification in which only the parameters of a group of adjacent bands are adjusted at one time. Automatic computer programs have been written for five of the methods, and for the moving subspace modification. These will be published elsewhere.If the computed curve is convoluted with the spectral slit function before making the least squares calculations, the distortion of the observed spectrum caused by the finite spectral slit width can be corrected. In some cases this method of diminishing the slit distortion is better than direct methods, particularly when dealing with strongly overlapped bands.},

  abstract = {Background Recently, multi-planar reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) spiral chest CT scan has demonstrated superiority in the evaluation of the tracheobronchial tree. The goal of this study was to measure the lengths of the right and left main bronchi and their anteroposterior (AP) and transverse (TR) diameters using the 3D and two-dimensional (2D) images in the same adult respectively, and to evaluate the degree of correlation between them. Methods We measured the lengths of the right and left main bronchi from the carina to the first of their branches and the AP and TR diameters at the mid-portion of the right main bronchus and 2 cm below the carina in the left main bronchus. We determined the size of the left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT) based on the measured AP diameter of the left main bronchus from the 3D and 2D images, respectively. Results There was moderate correlation between the lengths of both main bronchi obtained from the 3D images and the 2D images, and between the AP diameter of the left main bronchus obtained from the 3D images and the 2D images. Same sized DLTs were estimated in 69\% of the men and 34\% of the women. Conclusions The lengths of the right and left main bronchi and their AP and TR diameters obtained from 3D images were not strongly correlated with those from 2D images. Therefore, a further study is needed to verify the superiority of 3D images in selecting the appropriate size of left-sided DLT.},

  abstract = {The physical basis for breast tumor detection with microwave imaging is the contrast in dielectric properties of normal and malignant breast tissues. Confocal microwave imaging involves illuminating the breast with an ultra-wideband pulse from a number of antenna locations, then synthetically focusing reflections from the breast. The detection of malignant tumors is achieved by the coherent addition of returns from these strongly scattering objects. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and localizing small ( 1 cm) tumors in three dimensions with numerical models of two system configurations involving synthetic cylindrical and planar antenna arrays. Image formation algorithms are developed to enhance tumor responses and reduce early- and late-time clutter. The early-time clutter consists of the incident pulse and reflections from the skin, while the late-time clutter is primarily due to the heterogeneity of breast tissue. Successful detection of 6-mm-diameter spherical tumors is achieved with both planar and cylindrical systems, and similar performance measures are obtained. The influences of the synthetic array size and position relative to the tumor are also explored.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a frequency-tunable constant-bandwidth waveguide filter structure with contactless tuning plungers. For the purpose of adjusting the center frequency of the filter, we, for the first time, developed the contactless plungers of waveguide corrugation structure. The new plungers do not require any electrical and mechanical contacts with the waveguide circular resonators, and this allows the plungers to move freely. Although each plunger does not have electrical and mechanical contacts with each resonator, its Q-factor is comparable to a conventional resonator with no openings. We have also developed a design method for a frequency-tunable waveguide filter capable of having a constant absolute bandwidth. The tuning plungers are used only for the resonators, and the coupling structures are designed to be static in order to minimize the number of tuning devices. For demonstration, a fourth-order waveguide filter has been designed, fabricated, and measured. The measurement shows that it can be tuned from 19.00 to 19.48 GHz having the absolute bandwidth of 54.5 {$\pm$} 2.5 MHz.},

There are several methods for detergent removal, but the procedures are complicated or suffer from sample loss. Here, we describe a convenient and rapid method for detergent removal from sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids (gangliosides) and neutral glycolipids in detergent-resistant membrane microdomain (DRM). It is based on selective detergent extraction, where the sample is dried on a glass tube, followed by washing with organic solvent. We investigated 18 organic solvents and used high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-QIT-TOF MS) to confirm that dichloroethane (DCE) was the most suitable solvent and completely removed the non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100. Furthermore, DCE extraction effectively removed interference caused by other non-ionic, zwitterionic, or ionic detergents in MALDI-QIT-TOF MS analysis.},

  abstract = {A simple and convenient method for water-insoluble protein surface hydrophobicity determination was developed and validated. The method is based on the non-covalent binding of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (CBBG) to aromatic and basic amino acid residues on the surface of proteins, generating insoluble protein\textendash CBBG complexes that could be precipitated by centrifugation and cause a reduction in the absorbance at 585 nm in the supernatant. The amount of protein-bound CBBG is applied as an indicator of protein surface hydrophobicity. Thermally treated, water-insoluble myofibrillar proteins (MPs) were chosen to validate the proposed method. The amount of protein-bound CBBG increased in thermally treated protein samples and the results were compared with the surface hydrophobicity (S0) calculated by the commonly accepted fluorescence method using a 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) probe and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Results from the CBBG-binding method linearly correlated with the S0 of the ANS fluorescence method (R = 0.95), the maximum emission wavelength of protein intrinsic fluorescence (R = 0.96) and the intrinsic fluorescence intensity at 337 nm (R = -0.73), strongly suggesting the reliability of the proposed CBBG-binding method.},

Volder), Linear CORDIC, Hyperbolic CORDIC (John Stephen Walther), and Generalized Hyperbolic CORDIC (GH CORDIC) (Yuanyong Luo et al.),  is a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, square roots, multiplications, divisions, and exponentials and logarithms with arbitrary base, typically converging with one digit (or bit) per iteration.  CORDIC is therefore also an example of digit-by-digit algorithms. CORDIC and closely related methods known as pseudo-multiplication and pseudo-division or factor combining are commonly used when no hardware multiplier is available (e.g. in simple microcontrollers and FPGAs), as the only operations it requires are additions, subtractions, bitshift and lookup tables. As such, they all belong to the class of shift-and-add algorithms. In computer science, CORDIC is often used to implement floating-point arithmetic when the target platform lacks hardware multiply for cost or space reasons.},

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans. A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins.},

The method allows for rapid impedance measurement for a range of frequencies using a narrow input pulse, digital oscilloscope and FFT techniques. The technique compares well to current methodologies such as network and impedance analyzers while providing additional versatility in the electrical impedance measurement.

A gas-filled microchannel network functioning as an oxygen-nitrogen mixer generates differential oxygen concentration. By controlling the relative flow rate of the oxygen and nitrogen input gases, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in proximal microchannels filled with culture media are precisely regulated by molecular diffusion. Sensors consisting of an oxygen-sensitive dye embedded in the fluid channels permit dynamic fluorescence-based monitoring of the DO concentration using low-cost light-emitting diodes. To demonstrate the general utility of the platform for both aerobic and anaerobic culture, three bacteria with differential oxygen requirements (E. coli, A. viscosus, and F. nucleatum), as well as a model mammalian cell line (murine embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3)), were cultured. Growth characteristics of the selected species were analyzed as a function of eight discrete DO concentrations, ranging from 0 ppm (anaerobic) to 42 ppm (fully saturated).},

Rectal temperatures before and after exposure were measured on days 1, 6 and 12. Measurements made on day 1 were treated with caution because of heterogeneity in rectal temperatures taken before exposure between the groups of mice given different treatments. On days 6 and 12, rectal temperatures rose by approximately 1\textdegree C in mice sham exposed, or exposed to 1 W m-2 or 100 W m-2. Only in the group of mice exposed to 400 W m-2 was the mean rise in rectal temperature during exposure (about 3\textdegree C) significantly increased above the sham value. In groups killed 2\textendash 3 days after treatment (mainly meiotic exposure) frequencies of chromosome aberrations in spermatocytes showed no significant heterogeneity although the highest frequency of 1{$\cdot$}5 per cent was at the highest (400 W m-2 power density. Another group killed 30 days after 100 W m-2 exposures (spermatogonial sampling) showed no significant increase over controls in chromosome aberration frequency. There was a small but significant increase in sperm count with increasing power density in mice killed 12\textendash 13 days after exposure, but a non-significant one in those exposed as spermatogonia (killed 41 days later). Thus effects were markedly less severe than those reported previously by Manikowska-Czerska et al.

One type designed for a standard wave-guide cross section has a bandwidth ratio of 2.7 to 1. The design method is presented in this report with a detailed description of a number of particular junctions. Some of these models are for use with very thin wave guide, which is ideally suited for wave-guide filters; some for use with the more usual rectangular cross sections; and one for use with ridge ("loaded") wave guide. The latter junction is capable of at least a 6-to-1 bandwidth.},

We show design steps to give good prediction of VCO phase noise and power consumption behavior: (1) measured resonator frequencydependent parameters; (2) transistor additive phase noise/ noise figure characterization; (3) accurate tuning element model; and (4) bias-dependent model in case of an active load. As an illustration, the design of a 3.4-GHz bipolar transistor VCO with varactor tuning is presented. Oscillator measurements demonstrate low phase noise (-40dBc@100Hz and better than -100dBc@10kHz) with power consumption on the order of a few milliwatts with a circuit footprint smaller than 0.6cm2. The temperature stability is found to be better than +/-10ppm/\textdegree C from -40\textdegree C to +30\textdegree C. The oscillators are implemented using lowcost off-the-shelf surface-mountable components, including a micro-coaxial resonator. The VCO directly modulates the current of a laser diode and demonstrates a short-term stability of 2 {$\cdot$} 10-10 / {$\tau$} when locked to a miniature Rubidium atomic clock.},

The proposed LNA also has the capability for the simultaneous improvement of noise figure (NF) and linearity. In addition, we analyzed and verified that the second-order interaction, which affects the third-order nonlinearity, becomes less sensitive to the low-frequency input termination at higher bias currents. The possibility of removing the low-frequency LC trap is investigated based on this analysis. We also show that LNAs with smaller base and/or smaller emitter resistances require lower source impedance at low frequencies to improve linearity by the same amount. Finally, prudent layouts for improving the performance of the LNA are considered. Eleven design examples of the proposed LNA, which individually operate at 880, 1575, or 1960 MHz, are fabricated in a low-cost 0.35- {$\mu$}m SiGe BiCMOS process to verify the design and analysis experimentally. The fabricated LNAs have excellent performances, especially in NF. For example, the 880-MHz LNA has an NF of 0.9 dB, a power gain of 16 dB, and an IIP3 of +14 dBm with current consumption of 11 mA from a 2.8-V power supply.},

MAX881R is used in power supply for pulsed while LTI1964ES5-BYP with R2D Recon 2405 is used for high current application in CW. For pulsed applications in ON sequence the gate is turned-on 220 ms before the drain, while in OFF sequence the drain is turned-off 1.7 s before the gate. While in CW applications in ON sequence the gate is turned-on 130ms before the drain and in OFF sequence, the drain is turned-off 633ms before the gate.},

For the ion distribution analysis the capsid's structure was identical and fixed in both simulations. It was then released for the stability analysis. The ion distribution demonstrated two types of the local regions on the inner surface of the capsid's wall: highly occupied with chloride ions in both systems despite a largely uniform electrostatic potential everywhere on the surface, and the regions that loose almost all chloride ions in the unstable capsid. The latter regions are located close to the cracks that are formed when the capsid is destabilised and thus could initiate the collapse of the capsid.},

  abstract = {A magnetoelastic sensor immobilized with bacteriophage for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium in fat free milk is described. The response of the magnetoelastic sensors can be measured in the absence of direct physical wire contacts to the sensor, making the possibility of real time and in vivo bio-detection systems more realistic. The sensor system reported in this article is a combination of two rapidly developing technologies: magnetoelastic materials as a transducer and filamentous bacteriophage as a replacement to traditional bioprobes such as antibodies. Upon exposure to the target pathogen, the response of the phage immobilized magnetoelastic sensor changed, which was quantified by the shift in the sensor's resonance frequency. These frequency changes were proportional to the amount of target antigen bound to the sensor. Response of the sensors to increasing concentrations (5 \texttimes{} 101 to 5 \texttimes{} 108 cfu/ml) of S. typhimurium in two different liquid media (water and fat-free milk) was studied on sensors with dimensions 2 mm \texttimes{} 0.4 mm \texttimes{} 0.015 mm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographics of previously assayed biosensors were used for visual correlation of sensor response. A detection limit of 5 \texttimes{} 103 cfu/ml, with a sensitivity of 159 Hz/decade was obtained for the sensors tested in water samples, as compared to 118 Hz/decade in fat free milk. The dissociation constant Kd and the binding valencies for S. typhimurium spiked water samples was 136, 2.4 and 149 and 2.5 cfu/ml for spiked fat free milk samples.},

  abstract = {The conventional and most accepted method of measuring the lytic activity of a phage against its bacterial host is the plaque assay. This method is laborious, time consuming and expensive, especially in high throughput analyses where multiple phage-bacterial interactions are required to be monitored simultaneously. It can also vary considerably with the experimenter and by the growth and plating conditions. Alternatively, the lytic activity can be measured indirectly by following the decrease in optical density of the bacterial cultures owing to lysis. Here we describe an automated, high throughput, indirect liquid lysis assay to evaluate phage growth using the OmniLogTM system. The OmniLogTM system uses redox chemistry, employing cell respiration as a universal reporter. During active growth of bacteria, cellular respiration reduces a tetrazolium dye and produces a color change that is measured in an automated fashion. On the other hand, successful phage infection and subsequent growth of the phage in its host bacterium results in reduced bacterial growth and respiration and a concomitant reduction in color. Here we show that microtiter plate wells inoculated with Bacillus anthracis and phage show decreased or no growth, compared with the wells containing bacteria only or phage resistant bacteria plus phage. Also, we show differences in the kinetics of bacterial growth and the timing of appearance of phage resistant bacteria in the presence of individual phages or a cocktail of B. anthracis specific phages. The results of these experiments indicate that the OmniLogTM system could be used reliably for indirectly measuring phage growth in high throughput host range and phage and antibiotics combination studies.},

  abstract = {This study presents design and development of evanescent wave absorbance based U-bent plastic optical fiber (POF) probe with high sensitivity and its applications to refractive index (RI) sensing. The probes were fabricated by a controlled decladding procedure to remove the fluorinated polymer without damaging the poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) core and a simple and scalable fabrication technique to obtain POF U-bent probes of desired geometry. U-bent probes of fiber diameter from 250 to 1000 {$\mu$}m were fabricated and optimum bend diameter for each fiber diameter was investigated. The sensitivity was found to be maximum when the bend diameter of the probe varies from 2 to 3 times the fiber diameter. Probes with 500 {$\mu$}m core and 1.25 mm bend diameter showed highest sensitivity (5.57{$\Delta$}A560nm/{$\Delta$}RIU) in the visible region to RI changes from 1.33 to 1.47 with a resolution better than 1 milli RI units. Furthermore, U-bent probes were amine functionalized and coated with gold nanoparticles to obtain a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based RI sensor that has an 8-fold improvement in RI sensitivity, hence extending their applicability to plasmonic biosensing.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, which are the natural predators of bacteria, have re-emerged as an attractive alternative to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria. Phages are highly specific at the species and strain level and measurement of the phage host range plays an important role in utilizing the phage as antimicrobials. The most common method for phage host range determination has been to spot phage lysates on soft agar overlays and observe plaque formation. In this study, a liquid culture-based assay was developed in a 96-well microtiter plate format to measure the phage host range and virulence for a collection of 15 Salmonella phages against a panel of 20 Salmonella strains representing 11 serovars. This method was compared to a traditional spot method. The majority of the host range results from two methods were in agreement including in cases where a bacterial strain was insensitive to the phage. Each method produced a false-negative result in 19/300 (6\%) of the measured phage-host combinations when compared to the other method. The spot method tended to indicate greater phage sensitivity than the microtiter assay even though direct comparisons of the response magnitude between the two methods is difficult since they operate on different mechanisms. The microtiter plate assay was able to provide data on both the phage host range and virulence in greater resolution in a high-throughput format.},

The dielectric spectroscopy data analysis in the frequency domain can be reduced to the problem of choosing the appropriate model functions and an estimation of their model parameters. To address the latter problem a method has been formulated based on a penalized maximum likelihood approach, for obtaining a smooth estimate for the model parameters expressed as functions of temperature. The use of the Hilbert transform (Kramers\textendash Kronig relation) for dc conductivity evaluation directly from the complex dielectric permittivity data has been explored as well. In this paper a numerical algorithm for this procedure, using the fast Fourier transforms and a suitable interpolation technique, is suggested. Based on these methods, state-of-the-art software for dielectric spectroscopy data analysis in the frequency domain has been developed.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the subject of RF signal detection from the point of view of those who design and calibrate impedance matching bridges and other measuring instruments operating in the HF and VHF radio ranges. The principal discussion relates to the simple diode peak-detector; and covers the different possible circuit configurations, the associated theory, and the numerical methods needed for data analysis. Circuit techniques used to linearise the diode detector output are to be discussed in a separate document. Analysis of the detector transfer characteristic for sinusoidal input shows that the AC-induced error term involves the zero-order modified Bessel function of the first kind (I0). This result is not new, but it is often disregarded. The dynamic contribution is quite unlike the error that occurs for DC input, regardless of any compensatory modification of circuit parameters; which means that linearity correction schemes using a reference diode to produce a DC amplifier with a complementary gain law can never be perfect. It is also shown however, that the AC error is independent of frequency provided that the smoothing capacitor is 'large'. This means that the tracking detector system, which involves automatic self-calibration against a low-frequency precision rectifier, is theoretically sound. By considering the power dissipated in the detector, it is shown that the input impedance can be calculated using first and zero-order modified Bessel functions of the first kind (I0 and I1). This allows the determination of detector transfer-functions that take source impedance into account. When this facility is combined with the ability to calculate the dynamic component of the peak detection error, a measurement of DC output taken with a calibrated voltmeter can be converted into a measurement of AC input without the need for an AC reference. The computation procedures required are not simple, but they are described in detail and given as Basic algorithms readily adaptable to any programming environment.},

  abstract = {In radio and telecommunications a dipole antenna or doublet is the simplest and most widely used class of antenna. The dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each end. A dipole antenna commonly consists of two identical conductive elements such as metal wires or rods. The driving current from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between the two halves of the antenna. Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. This contrasts with a monopole antenna, which consists of a single rod or conductor with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground. A common example of a dipole is the "rabbit ears" television antenna found on broadcast television sets. The dipole is the simplest type of antenna from a theoretical point of view. Most commonly it consists of two conductors of equal length oriented end-to-end with the feedline connected between them. Dipoles are frequently used as resonant antennas. If the feedpoint of such an antenna is shorted, then it will be able to resonate at a particular frequency, just like a guitar string that is plucked. Using the antenna at around that frequency is advantageous in terms of feedpoint impedance (and thus standing wave ratio), so its length is determined by the intended wavelength (or frequency) of operation. The most commonly used is the center-fed half-wave dipole which is just under a half-wavelength long. The radiation pattern of the half-wave dipole is maximum perpendicular to the conductor, falling to zero in the axial direction, thus implementing an omnidirectional antenna if installed vertically, or (more commonly) a weakly directional antenna if horizontal.Although they may be used as standalone low-gain antennas, dipoles are also employed as driven elements in more complex antenna designs such as the Yagi antenna and driven arrays. Dipole antennas (or such designs derived from them, including the monopole) are used to feed more elaborate directional antennas such as a horn antenna, parabolic reflector, or corner reflector. Engineers analyze vertical (or other monopole) antennas on the basis of dipole antennas of which they are one half.},

  abstract = {The advent of quantitative PCR has improved the detection of human viral pathogens in the environment. However, a serious limitation of this method may arise from the inability to discriminate between viruses that are infectious and viruses that have been inactivated and do not represent a human health hazard. To assess whether propidium monoazide (PMA) pre-treatment is a good approach to inhibiting DNA amplification from non-infectious viruses, bacteriophage T4 survival was measured using cell culture titration and real-time PCR with and without PMA pre-treatment. Heat (85 {$\smwhtcircle$}C) and proteolysis methods were carried out. After these inactivation treatments, the results indicated that the PMA pre-treatment approach is not appropriate for differentiating infectious viruses. However, when a heat treatment at 110 {$\smwhtcircle$}C was undertaken, PMA pre-treatment did allow differentiation of non-infectious from infectious viruses. In this case, effective binding of PMA to bacteriophage T4 DNA could be taken to indicate capsid damage. Therefore, PMA pre-treatment may be appropriate for assessing effective disinfection treatments and for a more reliable understanding of the factors that contribute to viral inactivation through capsid damage monitoring. The PMA-PCR approach could be useful as a rapid and inexpensive analytical tool for screening and evaluation of the efficacy of disinfectants.},

In this study, we show that the application of the current and proposed limits for pulsed fields can lead to a temperature increase of 10\textdegree C for short pulses and frequencies between 6 and 30 GHz. We also show that the proposed averaging area of 4 cm2, that is greatly reduced compared with the current limits, does not prevent high-temperature increases in the case of narrow beams. A realistic Gaussian beam profile with a 1 mm radius can result in a temperature increase about 10 times higher than the 0.4\textdegree C increase the same averaged power density would produce for a plane wave. In the case of pulsed narrow beams, the values for the time and spatial-averaged power density allowed by the proposed new guidelines could result in extreme temperature increases.

  abstract = {In the presence of multivalent cations, high molecular weight DNA undergoes a dramatic condensation to a compact, usually highly ordered toroidal structure. This review begins with an overview of DNA condensation : condensing agents, morphology, kinetics, and reversibility, and the minimum size required to form orderly condensates. It then summarizes the statistical mechanics of the collapse of stiff polymers, which shows why DNA condensation is abrupt and why toroids are favored structures. Various ways to estimate or measure intermolecular forces in DNA condensation are discussed, all of them agreeing that the free energy change per base pair is very small, on the order of 1\% of thermal energy. Experimental evidence is surveyed showing that DNA condensation occurs when about 90\% of its charge is neutralized by counterions. The various intermolecular forces whose interplay gives rise to DNA condensation are then reviewed. The entropy loss upon collapse of the expanded wormlike coil costs free energy, and stiffness sets limits on tight curvature. However, the dominant contributions seem to come from ions and water. Electrostatic repulsions must be overcome by high salt concentrations or by the correlated fluctuations of territorially bound multivalent cations. Hydration must be adjusted to allow a cooperative accommodation of the water structure surrounding surface groups on the DNA helices as they approach. Undulations of the DNA in its confined surroundings extend the range of the electrostatic forces. The condensing ions may also subtly modify the local structure of the double helix. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Biopoly 44: 269\textendash 282, 1997},

  abstract = {Till the present time, the genotoxic effects of high peak-power pulsed electromagnetic fields (HPPP EMF) on cultured cells have not been studied. We investigated possible genotoxic effects of HPPP EMF (8.8 GHz, 180 ns pulse width, peak power 65 kW, repetition rate 50 Hz) on erythrocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis. We used the alkaline comet assay, which is a highly sensitive method to assess DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile lesions. Blood samples were exposed to HPPP EMF for 40 min in rectangular wave guide. The specific absorption rate (SAR) calculated from temperature kinetics was about 1.6 kW/kg (peak SAR was about 300 MW/kg). The temperature rise in the blood samples at steady state was 3.5 {$\pm$} 0.1 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. The data show that the increase in DNA damage after exposure of erythrocytes to HPPP EMF was induced by the rise in temperature in the exposed cell suspension. This was confirmed in experiments in which cells were incubated for 40 min under the corresponding temperature conditions. The results allow us to conclude that HPPP EMF-exposure at the given modality did not cause any a-thermal genotoxic effect on frog erythrocytes in vitro.},

Extensive investigations were carried out with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic purified DNA samples utilizing some of the most sensitive and precision instrumentation and methods available, while scanning the whole spectral region from 1Hz to 100KHz (in the low frequencies) and all the way to the high-frequency region of 100MHz (including investigations on the effects of 100MHz high-frequency fields as well as 2.4GHz microwave fields on the DNA). We were unable to detect any electromagnetism of any kind intrinsic to the DNA or its coupling to external noise sources, whether concentrated or diluted in water, as compared to control samples (H2O or empty chambers), neither existence of any possible spontaneous or stimulated/induced electromagnetic fields or waves emanated from both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic genetic material. Based on our measurements, we conclude that either there is no intrinsic electromagnetic activity or fields present in the DNA material, in both concentrated or diluted form, or any such activity is extremely weak in its intensity and beyond the measurement limits of current scientific methods.},

The structure of DNAFETs is similar to that of MOSFETs, with the exception of the gate structure which, in DNAFETs, is replaced by a layer of immobilized ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) molecules which act as surface receptors. When complementary DNA strands hybridize to the receptors, the charge distribution near the surface changes, which in turn modulates current transport through the semiconductor transducer. Arrays of DNAFETs can be used for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (causing many hereditary diseases) and for DNA sequencing. Their main advantage compared to optical detection methods in common use today is that they do not require labeling of molecules. Furthermore, they work continuously and (near) real-time. DNAFETs are highly selective since only specific binding modulates charge transport.},

  abstract = {In the spirit of Open Source Hardware, Dremelfuge is now Open Source Hardware, according to the 0.3 standard found here: http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW  DremelFuge is a printable rotor for centrifuging standard microcentrifuge tubes and miniprep columns. Compared to the cost of a new centrifuge (priced by a fellow Thingiversian at \$500 minimum on Froogle), a Dremelfuge is incredibly cheap. It can be used for DIYbio ( http://www.diybio.org ) or for some culinary uses. It requires industry standard 1.5ml/2ml Eppendorf/Microcentrifuge tubes. Used with a drill at 3000 RPM, the Dremelfuge will deliver over 400g, enough to comfortably spin down Miniprep samples (proven personally). It will likely achieve acceptable results at lower speeds, too. Used at 10krpm, on a Rotary tool for instance, a Dremelfuge should deliver over 4400g, more than enough to spin down bacterial cells. At 16krpm, Dremelfuge matches commercial centrifuges. On a Dremel 300, a maximum speed of 33krpm equates to a force of over 50,000 times earth's gravity, which puts it into so-called "Ultracentrifuge" territory. The latest version (as printed by Shapeways) has successfully spun tubes at this speed. To see some picures of Dremelfuge used to spin down cells, see here:http://letters.cunningprojects.com/?p=85 Quick Video Intro to Dremelfuge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86WnXeTZO\_Y (Update: This video hit over 1900 views!

  abstract = {When an ultrawide-band electromagnetic pulse penetrates into a causally dispersive dielectric, the interrelated effects of phase dispersion and frequency dependent attenuation alter the pulse in a fundamental way that results in the appearance of so-called precursor fields. For a Debye-type dielectric, the dynamical field evolution is dominated by the Brillouin precursor as the propagation depth typically exceeds a single penetration depth at the carrier frequency of the input pulse. This is because the peak amplitude in the Brillouin precursor decays only as the square root of the inverse of the propagation distance. This nonexponential decay of the Brillouin precursor makes it ideally suited for remote sensing. Of equal importance is the frequency structure of the Brillouin precursor. Although the instantaneous oscillation frequency is zero at the peak amplitude point of the Brillouin precursor, the actual oscillation frequency of this field structure is quite different, exhibiting a complicated dependence on both the material dispersion and the input pulse characteristics. Finally, a Brillouin pulse is defined and is shown to possess near optimal (if not optimal) penetration into a given Debye-type dielectric.},

Recent mouse studies show that avidity for host cells can play an important role in polyclonal antibody escape, and further that electrostatic charge of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein can contribute to such avidity. Methodology/Principal Findings We test the role of glycoprotein charge on sequence data from the three major subtypes of influenza A in humans, using a simple method of calculating net glycoprotein charge. Of all subtypes, H3N2 in humans shows a striking pattern of increasing positive charge since its introduction in 1968. Notably, this trend applies to both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins. In the late 1980s hemagglutinin charge reached a plateau, while neuraminidase charge started to decline. We identify key groups of amino acid sites involved in this charge trend. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge these are the first indications that, for human H3N2, net glycoprotein charge covaries strongly with antigenic drift on a global scale. Further work is needed to elucidate how such charge interacts with other immune escape mechanisms, such as glycosylation, and we discuss important questions arising for future study.},

Specific growth rates were reduced only at oxygen-supply rates much lower than those at which the total amount of growth was reduced.

Bacteria were instantaneously transferred between temperatures within and beyond the normal physiological temperature range (NPTR). Abrupt temperature shifts induced lag phases, but the degree of the response was dependent on the direction and magnitude of the shift. Temperature downshifts induced larger relative lag times (RLT; the ratio of lag time to generation time), than equivalent upshifts. The hypothesis of Robinson et al. [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 44 (1998) 83] that lag time can be understood in terms of the amount of work to be done to adjust to new environmental conditions and the rate at which that work is done was supported. Deviation of the reported proportionality between lag time and generation time was observed when late-exponential phase cells were subjected to abrupt temperature shifts from beyond the normal physiological range.},

Treated cells were subsequently incubated at refrigeration (4\textdegree C) and temperature-abuse conditions (12\textdegree C) for 5 days. When EHEC cells grown in LBB were subjected to non-thermal processing and subsequently stored at 12\textdegree C for 5 days, reductions in count of between 0.1 and 0.6 log cycles were observed and following storage at 4\textdegree C the decrease in counts varied between 0.2 and 1.1 log10. For bacteria cells suspended in RS values ranged from 0.1 to {$\geq$}3.9 log cycles at both storage temperatures. The most effective treatments were H-PEF and H-PEF/VP, both producing a {$>$}3.4 log cycle reduction of cells suspended in non-nutrient RS. Analysis of EHEC recovery on selective and non-selective media indicated no occurrence of sub-lethal damage for VP, PEF/VP, and H-PEF/VP-treated cells. The findings indicate that combining PEF and lytic phage may represent a suitable alternative to conventional fluid decontamination following further process optimization. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Risk assessment of typical intense pulsed light and laser intensities, spectral characteristics and the subsequent chemical, physiological and psychological effects of such outputs on vital organs as consequence of inappropriate output use are examined. This technical note focuses on wavelength, illumination geometry and skin tone and their effect on the energy density (fluence) distribution within tissue. Monte Carlo modelling is one of the most widely used stochastic methods for the modelling of light transport in turbid biological media such as human skin. Using custom Monte Carlo simulation software of a multi-layered skin model, fluence distributions are produced for various non-ionising radiation combinations. Fluence distributions were analysed using Matlab mathematical software. Penetration depth increases with increasing wavelength with a maximum penetration depth of 5378~{$\mu$}m calculated. The calculations show that a 10-mm beam width produces a fluence level at target depths of 1\textendash 3~mm equal to 73\textendash 88\% (depending on depth) of the fluence level at the same depths produced by an infinitely wide beam of equal incident fluence. Meaning little additional penetration is achieved with larger spot sizes. Fluence distribution within tissue and thus the treatment efficacy depends upon the illumination geometry and wavelength. To optimise therapeutic techniques, light-tissue interactions must be thoroughly understood and can be greatly supported by the use of mathematical modelling techniques.},

SARS-COV-2) as well as charged aerosols through the concept of electrostatic charge negotiation. (Fusion for the opposite types of charges and repulsion for the similar types of charges). Reviewing the works of different authors, regarding charges, surface charge densities (\{\textbackslash sigma\}), charge mobility (\{\textbackslash mu\}) and electrostatic potentials of different aerosols under varied experimental conditions, a similar intensive study has also been carried out to investigate the electron donating and accepting (hole donating) properties of the spike proteins (S-proteins) of different RNA and DNA viruses, including SARS-COV-2. Based upon the above transport properties of electrons of different particles having different dimensions, a mathematical model has been established to find out the penetration potential of those particles under different electrostatic fields. An intensive study have been carried out to find out the generation of electrostatic charges due to the surface emission of electrons (SEE), when a conducting material like silk, nylon or wool makes a friction with the Gr IV elements like Germanium or Silicon, it creates an opposite layer of charges in the outer conducting surface and the inner semiconducting surface separated by a dielectric materials. This opposite charge barriers may be considered as Inversion layers (IL). The electrostatic charges accumulated in the layers between the Gr IV Ge is sufficient enough to either fuse or repel the charges of the spike proteins of the RNA, DNA viruses including SARS-Cov-2 (RNA virus) or the aerosols.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that pressures inside dsDNA phage capsids can be as high as many tens of atmospheres; it is this pressure that is responsible for initiation of the delivery of phage genomes to host cells. The forces driving ejection of the genome have been shown to decrease monotonically as ejection proceeds, and hence to be strongly dependent on the genome length. Here we investigate the effects of ambient salts on the pressures inside phage-l, for the cases of mono-, di-, and tetravalent cations, and measure how the extent of ejection against a fixed osmotic pressure (mimicking the bacterial cytoplasm) varies with cation concentration. We find, for example, that the ejection fraction is halved in 30 mM Mg21 and is decreased by a factor of 10 upon addition of 1 mM spermine. These effects are calculated from a simple model of genome packaging, using DNA-DNA repulsion energies as determined independently from x-ray diffraction measurements on bulk DNA solutions. By comparing the measured ejection fractions with values implied from the bulk DNA solution data, we predict that the bending energy makes the dspacings inside the capsid larger than those for bulk DNA at the same osmotic pressure.},

The FDTD algorithm is coupled to a set of equations which describes both linear and non linear lumped elements. The simulation time step is adaptively adjusted by monitorng the convergence of the NewtonRaphson procedure adopted for the non-linear solution. This considerably speeds up the simulation, with respect to the adoption of a worst-case, fixed time step. The propagation of a high speed digital signal along a transmission lines is presented as an example. Simulation results are compared with SPICE outputs, showing excellent agreement.},

However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.},

Measurements made with nanowire arrays modified with antibodies for influenza A showed discrete conductance changes characteristic of binding and unbinding in the presence of influenza A but not paramyxovirus or adenovirus. Simultaneous electrical and optical measurements using fluorescently labeled influenza A were used to demonstrate conclusively that the conductance changes correspond to binding/unbinding of single viruses at the surface of nanowire devices. pH-dependent studies further show that the detection mechanism is caused by a field effect, and that the nanowire devices can be used to determine rapidly isoelectric points and variations in receptor-virus binding kinetics for different conditions. Lastly, studies of nanowire devices modified with antibodies specific for either influenza or adenovirus show that multiple viruses can be selectively detected in parallel. The possibility of large-scale integration of these nanowire devices suggests potential for simultaneous detection of a large number of distinct viral threats at the single virus level.},

  abstract = {The standard Finite-difference Time-domain (FDTD) method requires extremely small time-step sizes when modelling scattering objects that are large compared with the wavelength. This is especially so in modelling biological cells having sizes of the order of a few tens of micrometers. This can become impractical due to the unaffordable computation times required. This problem can be overcome by implementing a quasi-static approximate version of FDTD, based on transferring the working frequency to a higher frequency, to reduce the number of time steps required. Then, the generated internal field at the higher frequency can be scaled back to the frequency of interest. This paper presents an approach to modelling and analysis of the HH (Hodgkin and Huxley) membrane model that is represented as an electrical circuit on the surface of a biological equivalent spherical cell. Since the external medium of the biological cell is lossy material, a modified Berenger perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition is used to truncate the computation grid. The total fields of the simulated structures have been shown to give reasonable and stable result at 900 and 1800 MHz.},

Numerical results illustrating the dispersion characteristics of coplanar and microstrip lines, as well as the various electric field components coupled to highly lossy dielectric media, are presented. It is shown that the presence of a superstrate of lossless dielectric between the coplanar waveguide and the lossy medium plays a key role in setting up an axial electric field component that facilitates leaky-wave-type coupling to the lossy medium. The thickness of the superstrate relative to the gap width in the coplanar waveguide is important in controlling the magnitude of this axial electric field component. The coupling characteristics of the microstrip and coplanar lines are compared, and results generally show improved coupling if coplanar waveguides are utilized. Values of the attenuation constant alpha are higher for coplanar waveguide than for microstrip line, and for both structures alpha decreases with frequency.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic \& Optical Pulse Propagation presents a detailed, systematic treatment of the time-domain electromagnetics with application to the propagation of transient electromagnetic fields (including ultrawideband signals and ultrashort pulses) in homogeneous, isotropic media which exhibit both temporal frequency dispersion and attenuation. The development is mathematically rigorous with strict adherence to the fundamental physical principle of causality. Approximation methods are based upon mathematically well-defined asymptotic techniques that are based upon the saddle point method. A detailed description is given of the asymptotic expansions used. Meaningful exercises are given throughout the text to help the reader`s understanding of the material, making the book a useful graduate level text in electromagnetic wave theory for both physics, electrical engineering and materials science programs. Both students and researchers alike will obtain a better understanding of time domain electromagnetics as it applies to electromagnetic radiation and wave propagation theory with applications to ground and foliage penetrating radar, medical imaging, communications, and the health and safety issues associated with ultrawideband pulsed fields. Volume 2 presents a detailed asymptotic description of plane wave pulse propagation in dielectric, conducting, and semiconducting materials as described by the classical Lorentz model of dielectric resonance, the Rocard-Powles-Debys model of orientational polarization, and the Drude model of metals. The rigorous description of the signal velocity of a pulse in a dispersive material is presented in connection with the question of superluminal pulse propagation.},

  abstract = {The description of the energy density associated with an electromagnetic field propagating through matter must treat two different phenomena: dispersion, the variation of the refractive index with frequency, and dissipation, the loss of field energy by absorption. In many cases, as in common dielectrics, the dispersive medium is essentially transparent so dissipation can be neglected. For metals, however, both dispersion and dissipation must be taken into account, and their respective contributions vary significantly with the frequency of the electromagnetic field. Plasmonic structures such as slits, holes and channel waveguides always involve surfaces between dielectrics and metals, and the energy density in the vicinity of the interface figures importantly in the dynamic response of these structures to light excitation in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. Here we consider the electromagnetic energy density propagated on and dissipated at real metal-dielectric surfaces, including the important SPP, the surface plasmon-polariton wave guided by the interface. We show how the ``stored energy'' oscillates over an optical cycle between the plasmonic structure and the propagating surface mode, while the dissipated energy continues to accumulate over the same period. We calculate these energy densities for the case of the silver-air interface (using two data sets for silver permittivity commonly cited in the research literature) over a range of frequencies corresponding to the range of wavelengths from 200 to 2000nm.},

This limit impacted directed energy systems. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Research Task Group (RTG HFM-189) found this ultra-conservative limit had neither underlying biological mechanism nor adverse health effect to support its existence. A consensus statement recommended eliminating the high-peak-power ultra-short pulsed electric-field exposure limitation. The recommendation was adopted in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard IEEE-C95.1-2345TM-2014, "Military Workplaces-Force Health Protection Regarding Personnel Exposure to Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields, 100 Hz to 300 GHz", which is covered by the NATO Standardization Agreement 2345 Edition 4, 2015. Contact with metal surfaces energized by exposure to high-frequency emissions can lead to shock and burns. RTG HFM-189 concluded that reductions of contact current limits from 100 to 50 milliampere (IEEE) and to 40 milliampere (European Union Directive 2013/35/EU) were unnecessary (no adverse health effects), unscientific and resulted in unnecessary critical impacts to military operations and were subsequently revised to frequency dependent limits in IEEE-C95.1-2345TM-2014.},

  abstract = {Methods to measure the electromagnetic field intensity on a large scale should be improved to meet the growing demand in civil and military applications. The recent development and an application of a microwave electromagnetic field imaging method using a thermofluorescent device and detection in the visible-light range are described. The sensor is a flexible film sensitive to either an electric field (slightly conductive film) or a magnetic field (insulating film with ferromagnetic particles) coated with a polymer doped with fluorescent molecules displaying temperature-dependent emission. We use a lock-in thermography protocol consisting of modulation of the field at low frequency, which allows us to suppress the noise due to heat-transfer phenomena and the part of the signal not directly related to field absorption. Two applications of the method are presented: (i) imaging the microwave magnetic field emitted by a resonator antenna and (ii) the local probe measurement of the electric field inside a multibeam antenna. The process to develop the sensitive film, its detailed characterization, and the thermofluorescence-image demodulation postprocessing are presented in detail. This approach is much cheaper than one based on infrared thermometry and could permit democratization of microwave- and radio-frequency electromagnetic field imaging.},

Our SVAMs are low loss because they do not contain metals and are extraordinarily broadband, working from DC up to a cutoff. In the present work, a microstrip transmission line was isolated from a metal object placed in close proximity by embedding it in a SVAM so that the field avoided the object. Our paper begins by outlining a simple model for studying transmission lines embedded in SVAMs. We then present our design and experimental results to confirm the concept. 1.},

By constructing a fluorescence microimaging system with a submicrosecond time resolution we have been able to resolve temporally and spatially the events in a single cell under a microsecond electric pulse. An enormous membrane conductance, corresponding to a loss of 0.01-0.1\% of the membrane area, was observed in those membrane regions where the transmembrane potential induced by the electric pulse exceeded a critical value. The conductance decreased to a low level in a submillisecond after the pulse, leaving a moderately electroporated cell.},

The smart platform is developed to extend conventional Lab-on-a-Disc applications with an electronic interface, providing additional flow control and sensing capabilities to centrifugal microfluidics platforms. Wireless power is transferred from a Qi-compliant transmitter to the eLoaD platform during rotation. An Arduino-based microcontroller, a Bluetooth communication module, and an on-board SD-card are integrated into the platform. This generalises the applicability of the eLoaD and its modules for performing a wide range of laboratory unit operations, procedures, or diagnostic assays, all controlled wirelessly during spinning. The lightweight platform is fully reusable and modular in design and construction. An interchangeable and non-disposable application disc is fitted with the necessary sensors and/or actuators for a specific assay or experiment to be performed. A particular advantage is the ability to continuously monitor and interact with LoaD experiments, overcoming the limitations of stroboscopy. We demonstrate the applicability of the platform for three sensing experiments involving optical, electrochemical, and temperature detection, and one actuation experiment involving controlled heating/cooling. The complete electronic designs and example programming codes are extensively documented in the supplementary material for easy adaptation.},

  abstract = {This article presents a broad review on optical, radio-frequency (RF), microwave (MW), millimeter wave (mmW) and terahertz (THz) biosensors. Biomatter-wave interaction modalities are considered over a wide range of frequencies and applications such as detection of cancer biomarkers, biotin, neurotransmitters and heart rate are presented in detail. By treating biological tissue as a dielectric substance, having a unique dielectric signature, it can be characterized by frequency dependent parameters such as permittivity and conductivity. By observing the unique permittivity spectrum, cancerous cells can be distinguished from healthy ones or by measuring the changes in permittivity, concentration of medically relevant biomolecules such as glucose, neurotransmitters, vitamins and proteins, ailments and abnormalities can be detected. In case of optical biosensors, any change in permittivity is transduced to a change in optical properties such as photoluminescence, interference pattern, reflection intensity and reflection angle through techniques like quantum dots, interferometry, surface enhanced raman scattering or surface plasmon resonance. Conversely, in case of RF, MW, mmW and THz biosensors, capacitive sensing is most commonly employed where changes in permittivity are reflected as changes in capacitance, through components like interdigitated electrodes, resonators and microstrip structures. In this paper, interactions of EM waves with biomatter are considered, with an emphasis on a clear demarcation of various modalities, their underlying principles and applications.},

Direct implementations of transparent sources may not correspond to the original hard source spectrum, or else require auxiliary simulation steps for correction purposes. In this letter, we propose a more direct approach to construct FDTD transparent electric field source-models for waveguides. We also provide an explanation for a "spectrum distortion" phenomenon recently reported for FDTD sources in waveguide problems . The main findings are illustrated by means of FDTD simulations of waveguides operating at Ku-band.},

  abstract = {Safe reuse of wastewater requires high levels of pathogen inactivation. Ozone is a very effective disinfectant for viruses and has distinct benefits over other forms of disinfectants, in that it increases the clarity of water and can oxidize some chemical contaminants in water. However, because of the combination of high ozone demand of most wastewaters and rapid reaction with viruses, determination of ozone dose in wastewater and recycled water treatment is not well defined. While various surrogates are used as indicator organisms for human pathogenic viruses in water reuse practice, much less is known about the relationship between surrogates and human pathogenic viruses for ozone disinfection in wastewater. In this study, the ozone inactivation dose response of several surrogates (Escherichia coli, coliphage T1, T4, PRD-1, {$\Phi$}X174, and MS2) and human pathogenic viruses (poliovirus 1, echovirus 11, coxsackievirus B5, and adenovirus 2) were compared for the first time in secondary effluent wastewater. A unique reduction equivalent dose method was proposed to compare the inactivation of the microorganisms studied across waters with varying ozone demand. Inactivation of all viruses and surrogates studied was greater than 4\,log at ozone Ct levels of less than 1 (mg/L)-min. E. coli and PRD-1 were identified as conservative surrogates for indicating inactivation of human pathogenic viruses in ozone disinfection of wastewater, providing a tool for practitioners and regulators to confidently accept ozonation systems for virus inactivation in wastewater reuse.},

Different methods of treatment of those materials to eliminate the hazard of virulent and avirulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or avian influenza virus (AIV) were evaluated. The NDV strains tested were more thermostable than the AIV strains. The results suggest that standard pasteurization methods would not reliably inactivate the concentrations of NDV used. {$\beta$}-Propiolactone (BPL) ({$\geq$}0.025\%) inactivated NDV or AIV in allantoic fluid, but higher concentrations were needed to inactivate virus diluted in serum. Hemagglutination (HA) of NDV and AIV and hemolysis (HL) activity of NDV were reduced or eliminated by 0.4\% BPL. Formalin ({$\geq$}0.04\%) inactivated either virus but adversely affected HA and HL activity. NDV or AIV was inactivated by binary ethylenimine (BEI) (0.01 M) with no adverse effect on HA or HL. Heat (56 C) or BEI (0.01 M) had no apparent effect on hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titers of NDV and AIV antisera, the effect of formalin (0.1\%) was variable, and BPL ({$\geq$}0.25\%) depressed the HI titers of both antisera. The optimum method should achieve virus inactivation without harming the treated material. /// Huevos de parvadas infectadas con el virus de la enfermedad de Newcastle o con el virus de influenza aviar, lo mismo que reactivos para inmunodiagn\'ostico (virus o muestras de suero de aves), son potencialmente capaces de transmitir estos virus. Para eliminar el peligro que representa la presencia de virus en los l\'iquidos embrionarios o en algunos reactivos, se evaluaron diferentes procedimientos de inactivaci\'on de virus, tales como el tratamiento t\'ermico o con productos qu\'imicos como beta propiolactona, formol o etilenimina binaria. El l\'iquido alantoideo con virus virulento o avirulento de Newcastle o de influenza aviar se utiliz\'o directamente o diluido antes del tratamiento, para observar los efectos con respecto a la infectividad del virus, la hemoaglutinaci\'on y la actividad hemol\'itica.

La inactivaci\'on de los virus estudiados fue lograda mediante cada uno de los m\'etodos, aunque las diferencias en cuanto a temperatura, tiempo y/o concentraci\'on afectaron la infectividad y las actividades hemoaglutinante y hemol\'itica, adem\'as de los t\'itulos HI del suero. El virus de la enfermedad de Newcastle es m\'as termoestable que el virus de la influenza aviar, pero los efectos de los productos qu\'imicos inactivantes sobre ambos virus fueron similares.

A simple, rapid, robust, and reliable test, suitable for use in the field or at the patient's bedside, is urgently needed. In this study, the performance of a newly developed portable impedance biosensor was evaluated by comparison with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) and virus culture for detection of AIV in tracheal and cloacal swab samples collected from experimentally H5N2 AIV infected chickens. The impedance biosensor system was based on a combination of magnetic nanobeads, which were coated with AIV subtype-specific antibody for capture (separation and concentration) of a target virus, and a microfluidic chip with an interdigitated array microelectrode for transfer and detection of target virus, and impedance measurement of the bio-nanobeads and AI virus complexes in a buffer solution. A comparison of results obtained from 59 swab samples using virus culture, impedance biosensor and rRT-PCR methods showed that the impedance biosensor technique was comparable in sensitivity and specificity to rRT-PCR. Detection time for the impedance biosensor is less than 1 h.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the performance of a fast computational algorithm for modeling the design of a microfluidic mixing device. The device uses an electrokinetic process, induced charge electroosmosis [17], by which a flow through the device is driven by a set of charged obstacles in it. Its design is realized by manipulating the shape and orientation of the obstacles in order to maximize the amount of fluid mixing within the device. The computation entails the solution of a constrained optimization problem in which function evaluations require the numerical solution of a set of partial differential equations: a potential equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and a mass transport equation. The most expensive component of the function evaluation (which must be performed at every step of an iteration for the optimization) is the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that by using some new robust algorithms for this task [11, 16], based on certain preconditioners that take advantage of the structure of the linearized problem, this computation can be done efficiently. Using this computational strategy, in conjunction with a derivative-free pattern search algorithm for the optimization, applied to a finite element discretization of the problem, we are able to determine optimal configurations of microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Since 1959 with the proposal of Double Agar Layer (DAL) method for phage detection and quantification, many sophisticated methods have emerged meanwhile. However, many of them are either too complex/expensive or insensitive to replace routine utilization of DAL method in clinical, environmental and industrial environments. For that purpose, we have explored an alternative method for the detection and quantification of bacteriophages that fulfills the criteria of being rapid, simple and inexpensive. In this paper we have developed a method based on the analysis of optical density kinetics in bacterial cultures exposed to phage-containing samples. Although the decrease in optical density caused by cell lysis was one of the first observable consequences of the effect of viral infection in bacterial cultures, the potential of the method for the assessment of phage abundance has never been fully exploited. In this work we carry out a detailed study of optical density kinetics in phage-infected bacterial cultures, as a function of both, phage abundance and initial concentration of the host organisms. In total, 90 different combinations of bacteria/phage concentrations have been used. The data obtained provide valuable information about sensitivity ranges, duration of the assay, percentages of inhibition and type of lysing behavior for each phage concentration. The method described can detect, as few as 10 phage particles per assay volume after a phage incubation period of 3.5h. The duration of the assay can be shortened to 45min at the expense of losing sensitivity and increasing the limit of detection to 108 pfu/ml. Despite using non-sophisticated technology, the method described has shown sensitivity and response time comparable to other high-end methods. The simplicity of the technology and of the analytical steps involved, make the system susceptible of miniaturization and automation for high-throughput applications which can be implemented in routine analysis in many environments.},

Influenza virus is an unusual pathogen in that it is pleomorphic, capable of forming virions ranging in shape from spherical to filamentous. Despite decades of research on the influenza virus, much remains unknown about the formation of filamentous influenza viruses and their role in the viral replication cycle. Here, we discuss what is known about influenza virus assembly and budding, focusing on the viral and host factors that are involved in the determination of viral morphology. Whilst the biological function of the filamentous morphology remains unknown, recent results suggest a role in facilitating viral spread in vivo. We discuss these results and speculate on the consequences of viral morphology during influenza virus infection of the human respiratory tract.},

We present a finitedifference time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations that allows accounting for the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity typical of many near-surface materials. This algorithm is second-order accurate in time and fourthorder accurate in space, conditionally stable, and computationally only marginally more expensive than its standard equivalent without frequency-dependent material properties. Empirical rules on spatial wavefield sampling are derived through systematic investigations of the influence of various parameter combinations on the numerical dispersion curves. Since this algorithm intrinsically models energy absorption, efficient absorbing boundaries are implemented by surrounding the computational domain by a thin ({$<$}2 dominant wavelengths) highly attenuating frame. The importance of accurate modeling in frequency-dependent media is illustrated by applying this algorithm to two-dimensional examples from archaeology and environmental geophysics.},

  abstract = {A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model, proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model, including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular assemblies of unknown atomic structure.},

The combined properties of the fluid and the elastomeric substrate result in a flexible and durable antenna that is well suited for conformal antenna applications. Injecting the metal into microfluidic channels provides a simple way to define the shape of the liquid, which is stabilized mechanically by a thin oxide skin that forms spontaneously on its surface. This approach has proven sufficient for forming simple, single layer antenna geometries, such as dipoles. More complex fluidic antennas, particularly those featuring large, co-planar sheet-like geometries, require additional design considerations to achieve the desired shape of the metal. Here, a multi-layer patch antenna is fabricated using specially designed serpentine channels that take advantage of the unique rheological properties of the liquid metal alloy. The flexibility of the resulting antennas is demonstrated and the antenna parameters are characterized through simulation and measurement in both the relaxed and flexed states.},

  abstract = {Background Transbronchial lung biopsy is an important approach to diagnose peripheral lung cancer, but bronchoscopy based treatment options are limited and poorly studied. A flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled microwave ablation (MWA) catheter was developed to evaluate the feasibility and safety both in ex vivo and in vivo porcine models. Methods Using direct penetration of the catheter through the surface of ex vivo porcine lung, ablations (n=9) were performed at 70, 80, 90 W for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the catheter and 10, 15, 20 mm away from the tip were measured. Under bronchoscopy conditions in porcine lung, ablations (n=18, 6 in ex vivo and 12 in vivo) were performed at 80 W for 5 minutes. Computed tomography (CT) was acquired perioperative, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post ablation. Ablation zones were excised at 24 hours and 4 weeks respectively. Long-axis diameter (Dl) and short-axis diameter (Ds) were measured and tissues were sectioned for pathological examination. Results In-ex vivo lung, the temperature at 20 mm removed was over 60 \textdegree C at 80 W for 288{$\pm$}26 seconds. The ablations under bronchoscopic conditions were successful in-ex vivo and in vivo lung. No complications occurred during the procedures. Coagulation necrosis was visible at 24 hours, and repaired fibrous tissue was seen at 4 weeks. Conclusions The flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled MWA is feasible and safe. This early animal data holds promise of MWA becoming a potential therapeutic tool for Peripheral Lung Cancers.},

  abstract = {The fluorescence intensity of picoliter-volume samples was quantitated by taking samples and standards into a single siliconized capillary, fixing the capillary under the objective of a microscope-fluorometer, and defining an effective ``fluorescence chamber'' within the capillary by placing an imaging diaphragm in the emission path. Samples were then moved, by pneumatic control with an air syringe, within the capillary to this ``fluorescence chamber.'' A diaphragm in the excitation path limited the volume of sample excited. Fluorescence from all samples was thus directly determined under identical optical conditions. The co-efficient of variation of replicate measurements was 3\%; carry-over from sample to sample within the capillary was less than 2\%. A 3-pl sample containing 0.3 amol of sodium fluorescein (about 200,000 molecules) could be discriminated from the background; fluorescence intensity was linear with concentration for three to four orders of magnitude. Fluorescence intensities of NADH and an ammonia-o-phthalaldehyde-thiol adduct were also determined. Using this ``fluorescence chamber'' allowed straightforward scaling down of a fluorescence assay for urea in 20-pl samples, lowering the limit of detection to 10 fmol, three orders of magnitude below a previously reported microscale assay. This technique is applicable to many fluorescence assays used in studies of cell physiology, and should allow routine measurement of metabolites in individual cells or of enzymes in individual subcellular organelles.},

  abstract = {We report here the striking anisotropy of fluorescence exhibited by crystals of native green fluorescence protein (GFP). The crystals were generated by water dialysis of highly purified GFP obtained from the jellyfish Aequorea. We find that the fluorescence becomes six times brighter when the excitation, or emission, beam is polarized parallel (compared with perpendicular) to the crystal long axis. Thus, the major dipoles of the fluorophores must be oriented very nearly parallel to the crystal long axis. Observed in a polarizing microscope between parallel polars instead of either a polarizer or analyzer alone, the fluorescence polarization ratio rises to an unexpectedly high value of about 30:1, nearly the product of the fluorescence excitation and emission ratios, suggesting a sensitive method for measuring fluorophore orientations, even of a single fluorophore molecule. We have derived equations that accurately describe the relative fluorescence intensities of crystals oriented in various directions, with the polarizer and analyzer arranged in different configurations. The equations yield relative absorption and fluorescence coefficients for the four transition dipoles involved. Finally, we propose a model in which the elongated crystal is made of GFP molecules that are tilted 60\textdegree{} to align the fluorophores parallel to the crystal long axis. The unit layer in the model may well correspond to the arrangement of functional GFP molecules, to which resonant energy is efficiently transmitted from Ca2+-activated aequorin, in the jellyfish photophores.},

FMI offers the ability to create thermal maps of integrated circuits with a thermal resolution theoretically limited to 1 m\textdegree C and a spatial resolution which is diffraction-limited to 0.3 {$\mu$}m. Even though the fluorescent microthermal imaging (FMI) technique has been around for more than a decade, many factors that can significantly affect the thermal image quality have not been systematically studied and characterized. After a brief review of FMI theory, we will present our recent results demonstrating for the first time three important factors that have a dramatic impact on the thermal quality and sensitivity of FMI. First, the limitations imparted by photon shot noise and improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio realized through signal averaging will be discussed. Second, ultraviolet bleaching, an unavoidable problem with FMI as it currently is performed, will be characterized to identify ways to minimize its effect. Finally, the impact of film dilution on thermal sensitivity will be discussed.},

Taylor tapers give low sidelobes but high forelobes and aftlobes, plus a modest gain degradation. Inverse tapers give low forelobes and aftlobes but high sidelobes and large gain degradation. Uniform excitation gives comparable axial and transverse subsidiary lobes, and is probably the best choice. Focal shift, where the peak axial power density occurs between the aperture and the phase (geometric) focus, due to the1/R\^2factor, is accurately calculated for a uniform square aperture. Since peak axial power density available from a focused aperture depends only on aperture size in wavelengths and on distance, these focal shift results allow system trade-offs to be made.},

  abstract = {Cnidaria catch and kill their prey by means of nematocysts. A nematocyst consists of a capsule containing a coiled tubule. On triggering, the cyst extrudes this tubule in an extremely rapid manner. The mechanisms and driving forces of discharge are still unknown. We found nematocysts of various cnidarians to be acidic inside and propose that the pH difference between cyst matrix and cytoplasm drives the discharge of cysts. For large cysts of Aiptasia we calculated that the internal concentration of protons and protonated carboxyl groups is about 5~M. Cysts contain polyacids in a high concentration. At a low pH several of the carboxyl groups of the polymer are uncharged. The carboxyl groups dissociate when, on triggering, the proton concentration becomes balanced across the cyst membrane. The speed of protons in water is extremely rapid. Thus, the equilibration of the proton concentration initially results in a negative net charge within the cyst and therefore in a sudden electrostatic repulsion between the dissociated carboxyl groups of the polymer. This causes an increase in the pressure of the matrix against the cyst wall. We suggest that this nonosmotic pressure increase causes the first and extremely rapid step of discharge. We propose that in a second step cations and water are taken up, generating an increase in osmotic pressure. A change in the pH value may also facilitate the invagination and evagination, respectively, of the tubule.},

  abstract = {We describe a frequency-domain lifetime fluorometer based on a microscope and a modulated light-emitting diode (LED) excitation source (370/460 nm), which operates in the frequency range 120 Hz\textendash 250 MHz. We collected multifrequency phase and modulation fluorescence responses from cellular areas as small as 10\textendash 15 \textmu m in diameter. We also collected fluorescence lifetime data from cells stained by a lipophilic coumarin sensitized europium fluorophore, Coum-Eu, with a millisecond lifetime, and Ru(bpy)2phe-C12, with microsecond lifetime. Nanosecond lifetimes from native nuclei stained with SYTO 14 and SYTO 16 probes were measured as well. We demonstrate that a simple LED excitation source can, for many applications, successfully replace complex and expensive laser systems, which have been used for cellular frequency-domain lifetime measurements. As the LEDs are very stable with low noise, it will be possible to image even smaller sample areas using brighter LEDs. With availability of modulated LEDs emitting at several wavelengths covering almost the entire visible spectrum it is easy to assemble a system for the fluorophore of choice. The ability to select an excitation source for a given fluorophore and low price make such an excitation source even more practical.},

  abstract = {In conventional microscopes, fluorescence emission is separated from the backscattered illumination using the Stokes shift, whereby the emission occurs at a longer wavelength to the excitation. Such separation is usually achieved through a combination of wavelength filters that divide the spectrum into mutually exclusive excitation and emission bands. It is therefore impossible in these microscopes to access the full excitation/emission spectrum of the specimen in a single image. We report on a microscope that acquired fluorescence images using illumination across the spectral range 450\textendash 680 nm; the full emission spectrum was detected simultaneously across the same range. The microscope was also combined with structured illumination optical sectioning to give three-dimensionally resolved images with improved background rejection. Full spectrum fluorescence images of biological specimens are demonstrated. As this system is more versatile than the standard fluorescence microscope, it could be of benefit in many fluorescence imaging applications.},

  abstract = {There has been ongoing debate and discussion concerning whether the funding source influenced the outcome of research on human health effects from exposure to radiofrequency fields (RF, electromagnetic waves that carry energy as they propagate in air and dense media). In a study of 225 publications, in which we sought to determine a possible association between the funding source(s), quality and outcome in a total of 2,160 genetic damage assessment tests of mammalian cells exposed to RF energy, we made several observations. One finding was that a great majority of researchers had acknowledged government agencies as the funding source (53\%, 120 of 225 publications), while a small number of scientists mentioned mobile phone industry as the financial source (9\%, 20 of 225 publications). Numerous investigators did not mention the funding source (26\%, 58 of 225 publications). Secondly, industry-funded investigations were of better quality and utilized quality control measures, i.e., blind evaluation, adequate description of dosimetry, positive controls and/or sham-exposed controls, compared to those funded by the government. Another observation was that in industry-funded studies, the d values (effect size or standardized mean difference between the cells exposed to RF energy and sham-exposed controls) were consistently lower than in government-funded studies. In addition, compared to government-funded studies, a higher percentage of industry-funded studies reported no difference in genetic damage between RF- and sham-exposed cells (80\% for industry-funded studies versus 49\% for government-funded studies). Finally, we observed that industry-funded studies were less likely to report an increase in genetic damage in cells exposed to RF energy (10\%) compared to government-funded studies (23\%). In view of the large difference between the percentage of publications funded by government and industry (53\% or 122 of 225 publications for government, compared to 9\% or 29 of 225 publications for industry), caution should be used when debating and discussing the above observations. Overall, it is important to include the quality control measures in the investigations, and also mention the funding source in published studies.},

Will this trend continue to the power amplifier? Is this technology really cheaper to develop and manufacture RF product solutions than GaAs? Is SiGeC really the RF technology of the future, or only a short-lived fad to be pushed aside by RF CMOS?

  abstract = {We have previously shown that 207-nm ultraviolet (UV) light has similar antimicrobial properties as typical germicidal UV light (254 nm), but without inducing mammalian skin damage. The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200-222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200-222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.},

  abstract = {Half a century of research on membrane-containing phages has had a major impact on virology, providing new insights into virus diversity, evolution and ecological importance. The recent revolutionary technical advances in imaging, sequencing and lipid analysis have significantly boosted the depth and volume of knowledge on these viruses. This has resulted in new concepts of virus assembly, understanding of virion stability and dynamics, and the description of novel processes for viral genome packaging and membrane-driven genome delivery to the host. The detailed analyses of such processes have given novel insights into DNA transport across the protein-rich lipid bilayer and the transformation of spherical membrane structures into tubular nanotubes, resulting in the description of unexpectedly dynamic functions of the membrane structures. Membrane-containing phages have provided a framework for understanding virus evolution. The original observation on membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD1 and human pathogenic adenovirus has been fundamental in delineating the concept of ``viral lineages'', postulating that the fold of the major capsid protein can be used as an evolutionary fingerprint to trace long-distance evolutionary relationships that are unrecognizable from the primary sequences. This has brought the early evolutionary paths of certain eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal viruses together, and potentially enables the reorganization of the nearly immeasurable virus population (\textasciitilde 1 \texttimes{} 1031) on Earth into a reasonably low number of groups representing different architectural principles. In addition, the research on membrane-containing phages can support the development of novel tools and strategies for human therapy and crop protection.},

Virus recovery ranged from 91 to 103\% and was obtained with several bacteriophage strains. With poliovirus type 1, coxsackievirus B-4, and rotavirus SA-11 the recoveries were 100, 20, and 80\%, respectively, but toxicity to cell culture was encountered: after removal of the detergent by a second floating layer method the recovery was 32\% for poliovirus.

With the aids of o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and thioglycolic acid (TGA), putrescine was derived to become red derivatives (PUT-RD), the form that can be detected qualitatively and quantitatively by visual inspection and UV-vis spectrophotometer at {$\lambda$}max of 490 nm, respectively. Key parameters affecting the experiment were investigated by one-factor-at-a-time and response surface analysis. At the optimal condition, this colorimetric method achieved good linearity at putrescine concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 200 {$\mu$}M with detection limit of 0.44 \textmu M. The method also has good selectivity when common amino acids and inorganic ions, as well as ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine, 1,5-pentanediamine, and 1,6-hexanediamine were used as interferences. The established colorimetric method was successfully employed for the detection of putrescine in 10 commercial fish products.},

Conventional calorimeters used for this purpose measure radiation-induced heating in a water phantom at one point in space by means of immersed thermistors and are subject to various thermal disturbances due to Ohmic heating and interactions of the radiation with the sensor probes. By contrast, the method described here is based on a high-resolution ultrasonic system that determines the change of the speed of sound due to small temperature changes in an acoustic propagation path in the radiation-heated water, thereby avoiding such undesired thermal effects. The thermometer is able to measure tens of microkelvin changes in the water temperature averaged over the acoustic path of about 60 cm at room temperature, with root-mean-squared noise of about 5\hspace{0.6em}{$\mu$}K5\hspace{0.6em}{$\mu$}K{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mn{$>$}5{$<$}/mn{$><$}mtext{$>$}\hspace{0.6em}{$<$}/mtext{$><$}mi{$>\mu<$}/mi{$><$}mtext{$>$}K{$<$}/mtext{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}.

All volunteers receiving the higher phage dose showed fecal phage 1 day after exposure; this prevalence was only 50\% in subjects receiving the lower phage dose. No fecal phage was detectable a week after a 2-day course of oral phage application. Oral phage application did not cause a decrease in total fecal E. coli counts. In addition, no substantial phage T4 replication on the commensal E. coli population was observed. No adverse events related to phage application were reported. Serum transaminase levels remained in the normal range, and neither T4 phage nor T4-specific antibodies were observed in the serum of the subjects at the end of the study. This is, to our knowledge, the first safety test in the recent English literature which has measured the bioavailability of oral phage in humans and is thus a first step to the rational evaluation of phage therapy for diarrheal diseases.},

This paper gives examples of today's regulatory requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the body. Simulation results show that about 34\% to 42\% of the incident power is reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation of safety compliance is proposed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. Conclusion Please cite this work as Gautret et al.

As radiofrequency EMFs at sufficiently high power levels can adversely affect health, ICNIRP published Guidelines in 1998 for human exposure to time-varying EMFs up to 300 GHz, which included the radiofrequency EMF spectrum. Since that time, there has been a considerable body of science further addressing the relation between radiofrequency EMFs and adverse health outcomes, as well as significant developments in the technologies that use radiofrequency EMFs.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Capsid proteins often present a positively charged arginine-rich region at the N and/or C-termini that for some icosahedral viruses has a fundamental role in genome packaging and particle stability. These sequences show little to no conservation at the amino-acid level and are structurally dynamic so that they cannot be easily detected by common sequence or structure comparison. As a result, the occurrence and distribution of positively charged protein domain across the viral and the overall protein universe are unknown. We developed a methodology based on the net charge calculation of discrete segments of the protein sequence that allows us to identify proteins containing amino-acid stretches with an extremely high net charge. We observed that among all organisms, icosahedral viruses are especially enriched in extremely positively charged segments (Q {$\geq$} +17), with a distinctive bias towards arginine instead of lysine. We used viral particle structural data to calculate the total electrostatic charge derived from the most positively charged protein segment of capsid proteins and correlated these values with genome charge arising from the phosphates of each nucleotide. We obtained a positive correlation (r = 0.91, p-value \&lt; 0001) for a group of 17 viral families, corresponding to 40\% of all families with icosahedral structures described so far. These data indicated that unrelated viruses with diverse genome types adopt a common underlying mechanism for capsid assembly and genome stabilization based on R-arms. Outliers from a linear fit pointed to families with alternative strategies of capsid assembly and genome packaging.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Significance Statement{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Viruses can be characterized by the existence of a capsid, an intricate proteinaceous container that encases the viral genome. Therefore, capsid assembly and function are essential to viral replication. Here we specify virus families with diverse capsid structure and sequence, for each capsid packing capacity depends on a distinctive structural feature: a highly positively charged segment of amino acids residues, preferentially made of arginine. We also show that proteins with the same characteristics are rarely found in cellular proteins. Therefore, we identified a conserved viral functional element that can be used to infer capsid assembly mechanisms and inspire the design of protein nanoparticles and broad-spectrum antiviral treatments.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Cryo-EM maps are sensitive to total nuclear and electron charges of a species whereas X-ray crystallography only visualizes electrons without a nuclear contribution. Cryo-EM can be used to identify charge and chemical identity., Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) directly images the distribution of electrostatic potential (ESP) within macromolecules, and thus can provide much more information about atomic charge than X-ray crystallography. The electron-scattering length of an isolated ion is quite different from that of the corresponding neutral atom. The difference is very large at small scattering angles where the effects of electron distributions are largest, but becomes smaller at high scattering angles where nuclear charge determines outcomes. For this reason, in cryo-EM maps that have been solved at resolutions lower than {$\sim$}2.5\hspace{0.25em}\AA, peaks corresponding to anions will always be less prominent than those of cations, and may even be negative. Furthermore, if a map of this kind is smeared computationally after the fact, which reduces its effective resolution, anion peaks will diminish in size, cation peaks will grow and peaks that represent uncharged atoms will remain about the same. These effects can be used to determine the sign of the charges carried by the ions associated with a macromolecule and even estimate their magnitudes. The ESP value for a cation in a cation\textendash anion pair is smaller than the value of the cation in isolation, but the ESP value for the anion in the ionic pair is greater than the value of the anion in isolation. The experimental range of ESP values for Mg2+ relative to that of the closest C1{${'}$} atom is found to be between 0.57 and 1.27.},

This process is spontaneous and driven by electrostatic interactions between positive domains on the virus coat proteins and the negative genome. We model the effect of the icosahedral charge distribution from the protein shell instead of uniform using a mean-field theory. We find that the non-uniform charge distribution strongly affects the optimal genome length, and that it can explain the experimentally observed phenomenon of overcharging of virus and virus-like particles.},

  abstract = {The resistive and reactive components of an impedance, including the sign of the reactance, can be determined by placing a resistance and a reactance in series with the impedance and making five scalar voltage measurements across pairs of points in the resulting network. It is also possible, using suitable combinations of the same 5 measurements, to determine impedance magnitude, phase tangent, conductance, susceptance, power factor, and (by making the reference resistance equal to the target load resistance) reflection coefficient and SWR. This article gives expressions for all of these quantities; and includes an error analysis in each instance to show how a standard deviation can be calculated. The error functions are well-behaved except for those related to the voltage reflection coefficient, the expression for which is not differentiable when its value is in the region of zero. A solution to that problem is to place a potential divider across the generator and make an additional bridge voltage measurement, this configuration being the same as is used in antenna analysers and return loss bridges. Although not suitable for permanent insertion into a transmission line; the series network can be used for simultaneous determination of load resistance, conductance and phase tangent, as is required for guaranteed convergence of impedance matching procedures involving series and parallel reactances.},

The electrode interface impedance components (R/sub i/, X/sub i/) and the culture medium component R/sub m/ were separated by making use of the Warburg's model frequency dependent properties. Measurements were carried out from 18 Hz to 18 kHz with a constant current impedance bridge as growth proceeded. Growth curves for R/sub i/ and X/sub i/ showed a similar temporal pattern within the frequency range of 18-100 Hz. Dispersion was not observed in R/sub m/, meaning that the same growth response was obtained within the 18-18000-Hz range. At low frequency, the resistive and capacitive reactive components, or R/sub i/ and X/sub b/, respectively, were directly measured, where R/sub b/=(2*R/sub i/+R/sub m/) and X/sub b/=2*X/sub i/ and, above 5 kHz, R/sub m/ was obtained (for Z/sub i/ is negligible). Thus, R/sub i/ was easily discriminated from R/sub m/ by simple arithmetic. In four experiments, the maximum spread of X/sub i/, R/sub i/, and R/sub m/ was smaller than 5\% indicating good repeatability. There is potential new information in dissecting out the growth curve in three separate component curves.{$<>$}},

Using the fabricated electrode-based chip and impedance spectroscopy, we measured the impedance spectra of Vero cells during the cultivation or infection with HSV at the low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0006 even. The state of Vero cells during the cultivation or HSV infection was clearly reflected in impedance measurements and microscopic observations. From analyses of impedance spectra, it was shown that the monitoring of parameters related with cell/cell or cell/substrate junction is useful to understand the cell behaviour and also to quantify the influence of HSV infection on Vero cells sensitively. Further, the fitted parameters depended on the MOI of HSV.},

The produced surfaces have been characterised by EIS and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy and have been applied to bacteria detection. Compared to immunocapture, detection using phages generates successive dual signals of opposite trend over time, which consist of an initial increase in impedance caused by bacteria capture followed by impedance decrease attributed to phage-induced lysis. Such dual signals can be easily distinguished from those caused by non-specific adsorption and/or crossbinding, which helps to circumvent one of the main drawbacks of reagentless biosensors based in a single target-binding event. The described strategy has generated specific detection of Escherichia coli in the range of 104\textendash 107 CFU mL-1 and minimal interference by non-target Lactobacillus. We propose that the utilisation of phages as capture biocomponent for bacteria capture and EIS detection allows in-chip signal confirmation.},

Due to the severity of this disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that manipulation of active viral cultures of SARS-CoV be performed in containment laboratories at biosafety level 3 (BSL3). The virus was inactivated by ultraviolet light (UV) at 254~nm, heat treatment of 65~\textdegree C or greater, alkaline (pH {$>$} 12) or acidic (pH {$<$} 3) conditions, formalin and glutaraldehyde treatments. We describe the kinetics of these efficient viral inactivation methods, which will allow research with SARS-CoV containing materials, that are rendered non-infectious, to be conducted at reduced safety levels.},

  abstract = {Background: In the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, finding viral nucleic acids on hospital surfaces suggested surfaces could play a role in spread in health care environments. Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces. Methods: The efficacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/ p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70\% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62\% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71\% ethanol). Results: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log10 reduction factor of 3.2 for 70\% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62\% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71\% ethanol. For MHV, log10 reduction factors were 3.9 for 70\% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62\% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71\% ethanol. Conclusion: Only ethanol reduced infectivity of the 2 coronaviruses by .3-log10 after 1 minute. Germicides must be chosen carefully to ensure they are effective against viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.},

Here, we aimed to analyse a universally applicable inactivation procedure, namely microwave irradiation, as a safe and effective method to reduce the risk of viral transmission. The exposure of HCV from different genotypes to microwave irradiation resulted in a significant reduction of viral infectivity. Furthermore, microwave irradiation reduced viral infectivity of HIV-1 and of HCV/HIV-1 suspensions indicating that this inactivation may be effective at preventing co-infections. To translate microwave irradiation as prevention method to used drug preparation equipment, we could further show that HCV as well as HIV-1 infectivity could be abrogated in syringes and filters. This study demonstrates the power of microwave irradiation for the reduction of viral transmission and establishment of this safety strategy could help reduce the transmission of blood-borne viruses.},

  abstract = {A new approach is presented for modelling three-dimensional lumped elements in the "nite-di!erence time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations. The "nite-di!erence equations for the lumped element's circuit behaviour are derived to produce discrete relationships between the device's terminal currents and voltages. These di!erence equations are then implemented in the FDTD grid with equivalent voltage and current sources based on static "eld approximations. The method can be used for a wide range of applications which include lumped elements that may be passive, active, linear, non-linear, single, and multiple port devices. The underlying advantages of modelling a lumped element in this manner as compared to the more traditional extended FDTD technique is that the lumped element is easily extended across multiple FDTD cells and the need for a separate transcendental equation solver is eliminated. The method is demonstrated by a speci"c example based on the Curtice\vphantom\{\}Cubic non-linear model for a MESFET. The s-parameters from an FDTD simulation are compared to the manufacturer's measured data and to results from simulations using Hewlett-Packard's Microwave Design System (MDS). Finally, the method is used to model the MESFET in a three port oscillator. Copyright 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Influenza infection is associated with about 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations every year in the United States. The continuous emergence of new influenza virus strains due to mutation and re-assortment complicates the control of the virus and necessitates the permanent development of novel drugs and vaccines. The laboratory-based study of influenza requires a reliable and cost-effective method for the propagation of the virus. Here, a comprehensive protocol is provided for influenza A virus propagation in fertile chicken eggs, which consistently yields high titer viral stocks. In brief, serum pathogen-free (SPF) fertilized chicken eggs are incubated at 37 \textdegree C and 55-60\% humidity for 10-11 days. Over this period, embryo development can be easily monitored using an egg candler. Virus inoculation is carried out by injection of virus stock into the allantoic cavity using a needle. After 2 days of incubation at 37 \textdegree C, the eggs are chilled for at least 4 hr at 4 \textdegree C. The eggshell above the air sac and the chorioallantoic membrane are then carefully opened, and the allantoic fluid containing the virus is harvested. The fluid is cleared from debris by centrifugation, aliquoted and transferred to -80 \textdegree C for long-term storage. The large amount (5-10 ml of virus-containing fluid per egg) and high virus titer which is usually achieved with this protocol has made the usage of eggs for virus preparation our favorable method, in particular for in vitro studies which require large quantities of virus in which high dosages of the same virus stock are needed.},

Here we employed small-angle X-ray scattering, atomic force microscopy and zeta-potential measurements to characterize the overall structure and association behavior of the full-length M1 at different pH conditions. We demonstrate that the protein consists of a globular N-terminal domain and a flexible C-terminal extension. The globular N-terminal domain of M1 monomers appears preserved in the range of pH from 4.0 to 6.8, while the C-terminal domain remains flexible and the tendency to form multimers changes dramatically. We found that the protein multimerization process is reversible, whereby the binding between M1 molecules starts to break around pH 6. A predicted electrostatic model of M1 self-assembly at different pH revealed a good agreement with zeta-potential measurements, allowing one to assess the role of M1 domains in M1-M1 and M1-lipid interactions. Together with the protein sequence analysis, these results provide insights into the mechanism of M1 scaffold formation and the major role of the flexible and disordered C-terminal domain in this process.},

  abstract = {Background: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold, while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Introduction: Coronaviruses are the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, within the family of Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses is approximately from 26 to 32 kilobases. Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s and Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. The earliest ones studied were from human patients with the common cold, which were later named human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43. Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HKU1 in 2005, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Most of these have involved serious respiratory tract infections. Result and discussion: Based on our multidisciplinary research, we have found the major cause and some treatments methods for fighting this powerful pathogen. The prime cause of COVID-19 is pushing the mitochondrial to lose MMP. A loss of the MMP by any mechanism leads to functional and structural collapse of the mitochondria and cell death. Mitophagy plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, but can also eliminate healthy mitochondria in cases such as cell starvation, viral invasion, and erythroid cell differentiation. The mitochondrial fusion and fission are highly dynamic. Viruses specially COVID-19, interfere with these processes to distort mitochondrial dynamic to facilitate their proliferation. Thus, interfering with these processes promotes the interference of different cellular signaling pathways. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) escapes the innate immune response by translocating its ORF-9b to mitochondria and promotes proteosomal degradation of dynamin-like protein (Drp1) leading to mitochondrial fission. We also researched on Ultrasonic Energy to destroy the virus which lead to positive results but it needs more future research.The most destructive way of viruses is to enhance Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and free radicals in human contaminated cell which cause inflammation in a host cell. ELF-EMF convert free radicals into less active molecules and eliminate them into two pathways which has been discussed in the discussion part. Using ELF-EMF affects the second pathway that relies on the activity of the catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes which is the most effective pathway. For the best result of treatment, is the use of low-frequency magnetic fields (LFMF) plus EMF-ELF which penetrate into deeper tissues, cells and mitochondria. We also have gone through many researches since 1920 and found if we emit the frequency as the same frequency of COVID-19, can cause resonance in the virus and destroy it. So we measured the SARS-CoV-2 frequency by Cyclotron and calculated the frequency of the virus is 30 KHz-500 KHz. Conclusion: COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the most complex virus which has been discovered since 2020. Until today, there has been no Antiviral Drug which can be useful in the treatment of this infectious disease has been discovered till today. COVID-19 genomic sequence containing SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Influenza A. Therefore; there is a high possibility of continuing COVID-19 even in summer. To gain the best result in treatment, we should use low-frequency magnetic fields (LFMF) plus EMF which penetrate into deeper tissues, cells and mitochondria in order to reduce ROS and Inflammation. In order to destroy SARSCoV-2 virus in environment and also in infected individuals, we should use ELF-EMF plus LFMF. We also have gone through many researches since 1920 and found if we emit the frequency as the same frequency of COVID-19, it can cause resonance in the virus and destroy it. So we measured the SARS-CoV-2 frequency by Cyclotron and calculated the frequency of the virus that id is 30 KHz-500 KHz. The differences in the frequencies is due to the size of the virus which is from 26 to 32 Kilobases.},

  abstract = {"Do you want to design a wireless transmitter or receiver for hand-held telephones? Have you wondered why the printed circuit wires on high-frequency circuits don't always run in a straight line? This valuable text will answer all of your questions regarding component parasitics and circuit characterization for rf/microwave amplifier, oscillator, and filter circuit design and analysis. You will understand why capacitors act as inductors and vice versa and why amplifiers work like oscillators, while oscillators for local area networks work more like local area heaters. Application of the information in Introduction to Microwave Circuits will reduce design-cycle time and costs, markedly increasing the probability of first-time success in printed circuit or monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) design. Several approaches are taken into consideration, such as the effects of currents on the ground plane, bypass and coupling capacitors, and nonlinear effects in linear circuits. Featured topics include: * Incorporation of component parasitics in the design cycle * Closed form solution to oscillator design * Odd mode stability analysis * PIN diode analysis for high-power switching applications An integrated design example of a 1.25 GHz amplifier, oscillator, and filter printed circuit is also included, which could be useful in printed circuit board designs from tens of megahertz to tens of gigahertz. Introduction to Microwave Circuits provides the tools necessary to analyze or synthesize microwave circuits. This text is an essential reference for undergraduate students, microwave engineers, and administrators. Also, it will assist experienced designers in other fields to meet the current rapid expansion of communication system applications and work effectively in microwave circuit design. About the Author Robert J. Weber began his prolific career in the Solid State Research Laboratory at the Collins Radio Company, later a part of Rockwell International.

  abstract = {The dynamical evolution of an electromagnetic pulse as it propagates through a linear, temporally dispersive medium (such as water) or system (such as a dielectric waveguide) is a classical problem in both electromagnetics and optics. With Maxwell's unifying theory of electromagnetism and optics, Lorentz's classical model of dielectric dispersion, and Einstein's special theory of relativity, the stage was set for a long-standing problem of some controversy in classical physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. If the system was nondispersive, an arbitrary plane wave pulse would propagate unaltered in shape at the phase velocity of the wave field in the medium. For example, for distortionless wave propagation along the z-direction of a cartesian coordinate system, a one-dimensional wave is described by a single-valued function of the form f(z {$\pm$} vt), where the argument {$\varphi$} = z {$\pm$} vt is called the phase of the wave function. Any fixed value of this phase (for example, the value at the temporal center of the pulse) then propagates undistorted in shape along the {$\pm$} z-direction with the velocity dz/dt = {$\pm$}v. The first partial derivatives of the wave function f(z {$\pm$} vt) with respect to the independent variables z and t are then given by {$\partial$}f/{$\partial$}z = f{${'}$} and {$\partial$}f/{$\partial$}t = {$\pm$}vf{${'}$}, where f{${'}$} = df({$\zeta$})/d{$\zeta$}.},

  abstract = {Experiments with CHO cells exposed to 60 and 300 ns pulsed electric fields with amplitudes in the range from several kV/cm to tens of kV/cm, showed a decrease of the uptake of calcium ions by more than an order of magnitude when, immediately after a first pulse, a second one of opposite polarity was applied. This effect is assumed to be due to the reversal of the electrophoretic transport of ions through the electroporated membrane during the second phase of the bipolar pulse. This assumption, however, is only valid if electrophoresis is the dominant transport mechanism, rather than diffusion. Comparison of calculated calcium ion currents with experimental results showed that for nanosecond pulses, electrophoresis is at least as important as diffusion. By delaying the second pulse with respect to the first one, the effect of reverse electrophoresis is reduced. Consequently, separating nanosecond pulses of opposite polarity by up to approximately hundred microseconds allows us to vary the uptake of ions from very small values to that obtained with two pulses of the same polarity. The measured calcium ion uptake obtained with bipolar pulses also allowed us to determine the membrane pore recovery time. The calculated recovery time constants are on the order of ten microseconds.},

The grid drain-source bias voltage is 7.4V and the total drain current for the grid is 6.0A, resulting in an overall dc-to-rf efficiency of 23\%. The pattern of the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio was measured and found to be essentially independent of the radiation angle. The average SSB noise level was -87 dBc/Hz at an offset of 150 kHz from the carrier. An average improvement in the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio of 5 dB was measured for a 100-transistor grid compared to a 16-transistor grid.},

This electrostatic charge determines the mobility of the soft particle in an electric field and thus governs its colloidal behaviour which plays a major role in virus sorption processes. The pH value at which the net surface charge switches its sign is referred to as the isoelectric point (abbreviations: pI or IEP) and is a characteristic parameter of the virion in equilibrium with its environmental water chemistry. Here, we review the IEP measurements of viruses that replicate in hosts of kingdom plantae, bacteria and animalia. IEPs of viruses are found in pH range from 1.9 to 8.4; most frequently, they are measured in a band of 3.5 {$<$} IEP {$<$} 7. However, the data appear to be scattered widely within single virus species. This discrepancy is discussed and should be considered when IEP values are used to account for virus sorption processes.},

Here, we show damage-free removal of an epitaxial single-crystal GaAs film from its GaAs growth substrate using a laser that is absorbed by a smaller band gap, pseudomorphic indium gallium arsenide nitride layer grown between the substrate and the GaAs film.

Using rigorous virus purification, marked differences between virions and host were observed. Over 125 phospholipid species have been quantitated for three strains of influenza (HKx31- H3N2, PR8- H1N1, and VN1203- H5N1) grown in eggs. The glycerophospholipid composition of purified virions differs from that of the host or that of typical mammalian cells. Phosphatidylcholine is the major component in most mammalian cell membranes, while in purified virions phosphatidylethanolamine dominates. Due to its effects on membrane curvature, it is likely that the variations in its content are important to viral processing during infection. This integrated method of virion isolation with systematic analysis of glycerophospholipids provides a tool for the assessment of species specific biomarkers of viral pathogenicity.},

The use of a silicon substrate as a getter material increases significantly pumping capacity. This pump is technologically compatible with earlier developed high vacuum micropump and after their integration they could cover a very wide pressure range from 1000 hPa down to 10-7 hPa. This would enable on-chip generation of vacuum in variety of miniaturized devices.},

  abstract = {Turbidity describes the cloudiness, or clarity, of a liquid. It is a principal indicator of water quality, sensitive to any suspended solids present. Prior work has identified the lack of low-cost turbidity monitoring as a significant hurdle to overcome to improve water quality in many domains, especially in the developing world. Low-cost hand-held benchtop meters have been proposed. This work adapts and verifies the technology for continuous monitoring. Lab tests show the low-cost continuous monitor can achieve 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) accuracy in the range 0\textendash 100 NTU and costs approximately 64 USD in components to construct. This level of accuracy yields useful and actionable data about water quality and may be sufficient in certain applications where cost is a primary constraint. A 38-day continuous monitoring trial, including a step change in turbidity, showed promising results with a median error of 0.45 and 1.40 NTU for two different monitors. However, some noise was present in the readings resulting in a standard deviation of 1.90 and 6.55 NTU, respectively. The cause was primarily attributed to ambient light and bubbles in the piping. By controlling these noise sources, we believe the low-cost continuous turbidity monitor could be a useful tool in multiple domains.},

  abstract = {In general, the most difficult task in developing devices for fluorescence ratiometric sensing is the isolation of signals from overlapping emission wavelengths. Wavelength discrimination can be achieved by using monochromators or bandpass filters, which often lead to decreased signal intensities. The result is a device that is both complex and expensive. Here we present an alternative system\textemdash a low-cost standalone optical fluorimeter based on luminescence lifetime assisted ratiometric sensing (LARS). This paper describes the principle of this technique and the overall design of the sensor device. The most significant innovation of LARS is the ability to discriminate between two overlapping luminescence signals based on differences in their luminescence decay rates. Thus, minimal filtering is required and the two signals can be isolated despite significant overlap of luminescence spectra. The result is a device that is both simple and inexpensive. The electronic circuit employs the lock-in amplification technique for the signal processing and the system is controlled by an onboard microcontroller. In addition, the system is designed to communicate with external devices via Bluetooth.},

  abstract = {Since the 1990s, centrifugal microfluidic platforms have evolved into a mature technology for the automation of bioanalytical assays in decentralized settings. These ``Lab-on-a-Disc'' (LoaD) systems have already implemented a range of laboratory unit operations (LUOs) such as sample loading, liquid transport, metering, aliquoting, routing, mixing, and washing. By assembling these LUOs in highly functional microfluidic networks, including sample preparation and detection, a sizable portfolio of common test formats such as general chemistry, immunoassays/ protein analysis, nucleic acid testing, and cell counting has been established. The availability of these bioanalytical assay types enables a broad range of applications in fields such as life-science research, biomedical point-of-care testing and veterinary diagnostics, as well as agrifood, environmental, infrastructural, and industrial monitoring.},

This is 25\% less than the prohead mass deduced from its polypeptide composition, and this finding implies that the bacteriophage T4 prohead is built of fewer polypeptide copies than previously reported. In contrast, the mass of mature heads measured by STEM, 194 {$\pm$} 2 MDa, is in agreement with previous mass measurements of DNA and protein content, and it is consistent with the previously determined stoichiometry. This good agreement of average STEM values for proheads and mature heads with corresponding hydrodynamic measurements suggests that STEM allows faithful evaluation of the masses of large supramolecular assemblies (i.e., {$\geqslant$}200 MDa) such as whole viruses or cellular organelles.},

When using glycerol as a THz-PEA, the peak value of the THz signal which was transmitted through the fresh tissue and reflected by a metal target, was almost doubled compared to that of tissue without glycerol. THz time-offlight imaging (B-scan) was used to display the sequential glycerol delivery images. Enhancement of the penetration depth was confirmed after an artificial tumor was located below fresh skin. We thus concluded that the THz-PEA technique can potentially be employed to enhance the image contrast of the abnormal lesions below the skin.},

The ejection force arises from the energy stored in the capsid as a consequence of the viral genome (double-stranded DNA) being strongly bent and crowded on itself. The resisting force is associated with the osmotic pressure exerted by the colloidal particles in the host solution. Indeed, recent experimental work has demonstrated that the extent of ejection can be progressively limited by increasing the external osmotic pressure; at a sufficiently high pressure the ejection is completely suppressed. We outline here a theoritical analysis that allows a determination of the internal (capsid) pressure by examining the different relations between force and pressure inside and outside the capsid, using the experimentally measured position of the force balance.},

  abstract = {Explosive dehiscence ballistically disperses seeds in a number of plant species. During dehiscence, mechanical energy stored in specialized tissues is transferred to the seeds to increase their kinetic and potential energies. The resulting seed dispersal patterns have been investigated in some ballistic dispersers, but the mechanical performance of a launch mechanism of this type has not been measured. The properties of the energy storage tissue and the energy transfer efficiency of the launch mechanism were quantified in Impatiens capensis. In this species the valves forming the seed pod wall store mechanical energy. Their mass specific energy storage capacity (124\,J kg-1) was comparable with that of elastin and spring steel. The energy storage capacity of the pod tissues was determined by their level of hydration, suggesting a role for turgor pressure in the energy storage mechanism. During dehiscence the valves coiled inwards, collapsing the pod and ejecting the seeds. Dehiscence took 4.2{$\pm$}0.4\,ms (mean {$\pm$}SEM, n=13). The estimated efficiency with which energy was transferred to the seeds was low (0.51{$\pm$}0.26\%, mean {$\pm$}SEM, n=13). The mean seed launch angle (17.4{$\pm$}5.2, mean {$\pm$}SEM, n=45) fell within the range predicted by a ballistic model to maximize dispersal distance. Low ballistic dispersal efficiency or effectiveness may be characteristic of species that also utilize secondary seed dispersal mechanisms.},

The sensor only requires a simple reference scan of the interferogram for the FPI with its sensing chamber filled with air or under vacuum to determine the actual inter-reflector length. The sensor is validated by measuring room temperature dielectric constant ({$\epsilon$}r) at high frequencies around 1.4\textendash 4.7 GHz for three vegetable oils (corn, sesame, and olive), the synthetic Mobil\textregistered -1 engine oil, and mixtures containing sesame oil and water. The sensor has been also successfully demonstrated for determining {$\epsilon$}r values for the Mobil-1 oil at various temperatures and for the well-dispersed sesame oil-water mixtures of different compositions. The Bottcher's model of effective medium theory is shown to be better suited for predicting the {$\epsilon$}r of the sesame oil-water mixture than the Maxwell-Garnett and Bruggeman equations of spherical solutions.},

A survey of some of the mathematical techniques that have been applied to the propagation of electrical signals along nonlinear lines and ladder networks is presented, and the limitations of these techniques are discussed. The processes that both produce and limit pulse sharpening on nonlinear lumped-element delay lines are examined, and it is found that the wave equation, which describes the propagation of electrical signals along such networks, predicts that an electrical pulse will decompose into an array of solitons. An approximate formula for estimating the degree of pulse sharpening that can be produced on a delay line with a given number of sections is derived, and its accuracy is compared with experimental results. Numerical integration techniques for solving the nonlinear differential and difference equations that result from the mathematical analysis of nonlinear lines and networks are discussed, and the propagation of a voltage pulse along a lumped-element delay line containing nonlinear capacitors is simulated using a computer model based on an efficient algorithm.{$<>$}},

We report here on the optimization of oxygen transfer rates in deep-well microtiter plates and the development of a replication system allowing the simultaneous and reproducible sampling of 96 frozen glycerol stock cultures while the remaining culture volume remains frozen. Oxygen transfer rates were derived from growth curves of Pseudomonas putida and from rates of oxygen disappearance due to the cobalt-catalyzed oxidation of sulfite. Maximum oxygen transfer rates (38 mmol liter-1 h-1, corresponding to a mass transfer coefficient of 188 h-1) were measured during orbital shaking at 300 rpm at a shaking diameter of 5 cm and a culture volume of 0.5 ml. A shaking diameter of 2.5 cm resulted in threefold-lower values. These high oxygen transfer rates allowed P. putida to reach a cell density of approximately 9 g (dry weight) liter-1 during growth on a glucose mineral medium at culture volumes of up to 1 ml. The growth-and-replication system was evaluated for a culture collection consisting of aerobic strains, mainly from the generaPseudomonas, Rhodococcus, andAlcaligenes, using mineral media and rich media. Cross-contamination and excessive evaporation during vigorous aeration were adequately prevented by the use of a sandwich cover of spongy silicone and cotton wool on top of the microtiter plates.},

Here, we report a microfluidic long-term oxygenator which can support high-throughput parallel cell cultures under multiple defined oxygenation conditions (0 ppm \textendash{} 42 ppm). An array of oxygen-nitrogen gas micro-mixers is developed and fabricated in the device to generate stable oxygen concentrations for the oxygenation process. A water-jacket layer located between the gas layer and the cell culture chamber is applied to block evaporation and maintain conditions of culture media in the chamber. Furthermore, we perform simulations and experiments to investigate the functions of the gas mixers and the water jackets. We also conduct culture experiments to study the long-term growth (up to one week) and aggregation of three selected dental bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Fusobacterium nucleatum) under ranges of oxygenation conditions. These particular results can provide important insights on their roles in the dental biofilm formation. Overall, this work demonstrates that the long-term microfluidic oxygenation approach can effectively regulate defined dissolved-oxygen levels in cell microenvironments. Importantly, this oxygenation approach can be further applied to general long-term analyses of cells for their behavioral, metabolic and genetic responses, and their biofilm formation processes.},

It is shown that the well-defined and controllable height of the channels is advantageous for stopped-flow measurements of analyte binding. The easy fabrication of a fully transparent integrated sensor unit \textendash{} tape cuvette system is also demonstrated for parallel microscopic investigations. The transparent unit was used to on-line monitor the surface adhesion of Salmonella cells on poly-l-lysine-coated biochip surfaces, followed by the straightforward microscopic visualization of the adhered bacterial cells. The material of the double sided tape is stable in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, its material is biocompatible, making it ideal for biological applications. Excellent, stable and reversible bonding of the microstructured tapes to biocompatible plastic and glass is also demonstrated. The simplicity of the fabrication at ambient temperatures makes the developed processes appealing for lab-on-a-chip applications, particularly if the bonded biochips are precious.},

  abstract = {A new type of microfluidic flow distributor (referred to as the mixed mode or MM-distributor) is proposed. Its performance characteristics are determined using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), both in the absence and the presence of clogging, which is an important problem in microfluidic systems. A comparison is made with two existing, well-performing distributor types: the bifurcating (BF) distributor and an optimized diverging distributor, the so-called radially interconnected (RI) distributor. It was found that, in the absence of clogging, the MM-distributor produces only a little more dispersion than the bifurcating (BF) distributor, but much less than the radially interconnected (RI) distributor. The dispersion in an MM-distributor also follows a similar dependency on its width (power {$\cong$} 2) as the BF-distributor. The dispersion in the RI-distributor on the other hand displays a very disadvantageous 4th-order dependency on its width, prohibiting its use to distribute the flow across wide beds (order of millimeters or centimeters). These observations hold independently of the flow rate. With increasing degree of clogging, the MM-distributor rapidly becomes advantageous over the BF-distributor, owing to the fluid contact zones that are provided after each bifurcation step. This means that overall, and when the occurrence of clogging cannot be excluded, the MM-type distributor seems to offer the best possible compromise between the ability to cope with local clogging events and the dispersion in the absence of clogging.},

  abstract = {The microwave absorption of aqueous solutions of DNA extracted from E. coli has been studied between 8 and 12 GHz by the use of an optical heterodyne technique. By measuring optically the temperature rise produced in an absorbing sample by pulsed microwave radiation, unambiguous, direct measurement of the microwave absorption is possible. Our results show that E. coli DNA absorbs microwaves in the 8\textendash 12-GHz region substantially more efficiently than water, which is itself an extremely efficient absorber. The observed absorption is featureless and decreases slightly with increasing frequency. These observations are consistent with an explanation involving direct absorption by longitudinal acoustic modes of the double helix.},

Test results of sensors, computers, data busses, and actuators reveal that long standing fears of inherent fly-by-wire flight control system vulnerability to microwave radiation are unfounded. Some components, such as sensors and data busses, aren't affected at all. Others, such as the digital computers, fail at high power levels. The tests show that as long as the component shielding remains intact, component vulnerability is minimized. Good EMI design will give a harder system than simply relying on supposedly "EMI Proof" technologies, such as fiber optics. Testing revealed that inadequately designed fiber optic systems can actually reduce the system hardness to EMI. One conclusion is that the system shielding should be design controllable, that is, distributed between the airframe and component.{$<>$}},

In this work, we characterize and model the performance of a thin film microwave transmission line integrated with a microfluidic channel to heat fluids with relevant buffer salt concentrations over a wide range of frequencies. A microchannel fabricated in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is aligned with a thin film microwave transmission line in a coplanar waveguide (CPW) configuration. The electromagnetic fields localized in the gap between the signal and ground lines of the transmission line dielectrically heat the fluid in the selected region of the microchannel. Microwave S-parameter measurements and optical fluorescence-based temperature measurements are used with a theoretical model developed based on classical microwave absorption theory to fully characterize the temperature rise of the fluid. We observe a 0.95 {$\smwhtcircle$}C mW-1 temperature rise at 15 GHz and confirm that the temperature rise of the fluid is predominantly due to microwave dielectric heating.},

The sensor takes only 4-5 minutes for sensitive detection of up to 1-2 Colony forming units (CFU) of Escherichia coli. The present technique thus proves better than all presently available techniques in terms of both sensitivity and resolution and speeds up the detection process manifold. Microwave bio-sensing thus presents itself as a promising solution for rapid, sensitive and user-friendly detection of water contamination.},

  abstract = {Inactivation of collected viral aerosols is important for preventing a filter medium's serving as a fomite. The focus of this study was to evaluate the inactivation efficiency (IE) achieved through filtration coupled with microwave irradiation. MS2 aerosolized through a Collison nebulizer was fed into the system and collected onto the filter. For in-flight microwave decontamination, microwave irradiation was applied to an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) filter supported on a SiC disk for three cycles of selected irradiation times per 10 min (i.e., 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min/10 min) at power levels ranging from 125 W to 375 W. The survival fraction (SF) on the substrate and the IE through the entire system were investigated to determine the efficacy of this approach. SF decreased and IE increased as microwave power level was increased (p = 0.02 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively) or the application time was extended (p = 0.03 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively). Both measures changed sharply above a threshold temperature of around 90\textdegree C and reached 2 logs at 116 and 109\textdegree C, respectively. The log SF and IE of \textendash 2.59 and 3.62, respectively, were observed when the operating condition of 375 W for 10 min/cycle was used and the SiC disk facilitated microwave absorption. When a quartz frit was used as a support instead of the SiC disk, log inactivation efficiencies of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3 were measured at relative humidities of 30\%, 60\% and 90\%, respectively, under the same irradiation conditions. Relative humidity is a significant parameter from 50\textendash 80\textdegree C (p = 0.01). The results demonstrate that microwave-assisted filtration systems can be used as an effective means for inactivating viruses.},

The SMO is a compact, rugged and lightweight terahertz source capable of operating in the nearly unexplored near- and far-infrared electromagnetic spectrum. It will provide high power, highly efficient THz radiation for active illumination and/or local oscillators for applications in compact sensor arrays for THz imaging. Civilian applications of these devices include high-resolution radar, satellite telecommunications, remote sensing, line-of-sight networking, plasma and solid-state diagnostics, and high-speed computing. Other military applications of the SMO include line-of-sight networking and communications as well as chemical and biological spectroscopy. In the SMO, a tiny electron beam produced by a micron-sized cold-cathode interacts with the millimeter-wave fields of a miniature multi-vane cylindrical microcavity where the beam, as it rotates about the cavity axis, generates a terahertz signal inside the microcavity.

  abstract = {This study expands a previously developed model of a single cell electroporated by an external electric field by explicitly accounting for the ionic composition of the electroporation current. The previous model with non-specific electroporation current predicts that both the transmembrane potential Vm and the pore density N are symmetric about the equator, with the same values at either end of the cell. The new, ion-specific case predicts that Vm is symmetric and almost identical to the profile from the non-specific case, but N has a profound asymmetry with the pore density at the hyperpolarized end of the cell twice the value at the depolarized end. These modeling results agree with the experimentally observed preferential uptake of marker molecules at the hyperpolarized end of the cell as reported in the literature. This study also investigates the changes in intracellular ionic concentrations induced around an electroporated single cell. For all ion species, the concentrations near the membrane vary significantly, which may explain the electrical disturbances observed experimentally after large electric shocks are delivered to excitable cells and tissues.},

  abstract = {Characterization of the frequency response of coherent radiometric receivers is a key element in estimating the flux of astrophysical emissions, since the measured signal depends on the convolution of the source spectral emission with the instrument band shape. Laboratory Radio Frequency (RF) measurements of the instrument bandpass often require complex test setups and are subject to a number of systematic effects driven by thermal issues and impedance matching, particularly if cryogenic operation is involved. In this paper we present an approach to modeling radiometers bandpasses by integrating simulations and RF measurements of individual components. This method is based on QUCS (Quasi Universal Circuit Simulator), an open-source circuit simulator, which gives the flexibility of choosing among the available devices, implementing new analytical software models or using measured S-parameters. Therefore an independent estimate of the instrument bandpass is achieved using standard individual component measurements and validated analytical simulations. In order to automate the process of preparing input data, running simulations and exporting results we developed the Python package python-qucs and released it under GNU Public License. We discuss, as working cases, bandpass response modeling of the COFE and Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) radiometers and compare results obtained with QUCS and with a commercial circuit simulator software. The main purpose of bandpass modeling in COFE is to optimize component matching, while in LFI they represent the best estimation of frequency response, since end-to-end measurements were strongly affected by systematic effects.},

Knowledge of these parameters is of importance in understanding such interactions and is a prerequisite when assessing EMF exposure or when assessing or optimizing therapeutic or diagnostic medical applications that employ EMFs. In this review, computational methods that provide this information through full time-dependent solutions of Maxwell's equations are summarized briefly. This is followed by an overview of safetyand medical-related applications where modelling has contributed significantly to development and understanding of the techniques involved. In particular, applications in the areas of mobile communications, magnetic resonance imaging, hyperthermal therapy and microwave radiometry are highlighted. Finally, examples of modelling the potentially new medical applications of recent technologies such as ultra-wideband microwaves are discussed.},

  abstract = {Coronaviruses are large, enveloped RNA viruses of both medical and veterinary importance. Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly.},

In the past, the commonly employed viral detection methods were either cell-culture or molecule-level assays. Most of these assays are laborious and expensive, require special facilities, and provide a slow diagnosis. To circumvent these limitations, biosensor-based approaches are becoming attractive, especially after the successful commercialization of glucose and other biosensors. In the present article, I have reviewed the current progress using the biosensor approach for detecting intact viruses. At the time of writing this review, three types of bioreceptor surfaces (antibody-, glycan-, and aptamer-based) have been explored on different sensing platforms for detecting intact viruses. Among these bioreceptors, aptamer-based sensors have been increasingly explored for detecting intact viruses using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other platforms. Special emphasis is placed on the aptamer-based SPR platform in the present review.},

  abstract = {New methods to identify trace amount of infectious pathogens rapidly, accurately and with high sensitivity are in constant demand to prevent epidemics and loss of lives. Early detection of these pathogens to prevent, treat and contain the spread of infections is crucial. Therefore, there is a need and urgency for sensitive, specific, accurate, easy-to-use diagnostic tests. Versatile biofunctionalized engineered nanomaterials are proving to be promising in meeting these needs in diagnosing the pathogens in food, blood and clinical samples. The unique optical and magnetic properties of the nanoscale materials have been put to use for the diagnostics. In this review, we focus on the developments of the fluorescent nanoparticles, metallic nanostructures and superparamagnetic nanoparticles for bioimaging and detection of infectious microorganisms. The various nanodiagnostic assays developed to image, detect and capture infectious virus and bacteria in solutions, food or biological samples in vitro and in vivo are presented and their relevance to developing countries is discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a brief overview of Sommerfeld's forerunner signal, which occurs when a monochromatic plane-wave (frequency \{\textbackslash omega\}=\{\textbackslash omega\}\_s) suddenly arrives, at time t=0 and at normal incidence, at the surface of a dispersive dielectric medium of refractive index n(\{\textbackslash omega\}). Deep inside the dielectric host at a distance z0 from the surface, no signal arrives until t=z0/c, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Immediately after this point, a weak but extremely high frequency signal is observed at z=z0. This so-called Sommerfeld forerunner (or precursor) is highly chirped, meaning that its frequency, which is much greater than \{\textbackslash omega\}\_s immediately after t=z0/c, declines rapidly with the passage of time. The incident light with its characteristic frequency \{\textbackslash omega\}\_s eventually arrives at t\textasciitilde z0/vg , where vg is the group velocity of the incident light inside the host medium. Brillouin has identified a second forerunner that occupies the interval between the end of the Sommerfeld forerunner at t\textasciitilde n(0)z0/c and the beginning of the steady signal. This second forerunner is commonly referred to as the Brillouin forerunner (or precursor). Given that the incident wave has a sudden start at t=0, its frequency spectrum spans the entire range of frequencies from minus infinity to infinity. Consequently, the high-frequency first forerunner cannot be considered a superoscillation, nor can the low-frequency second forerunner be regarded as a suboscillation. The goal of the present paper is to extend the Sommerfeld-Brillouin theory of precursors to bandlimited incident signals, in an effort to determine the conditions under which these precursors would continue to exist, and to answer the question as to whether or not such precursors, upon arising from a bandlimited incident signal, constitute super- or sub-oscillations.},

This method utilizes near-field data to determine an equivalent magnetic current source over a fictitious surface which encompasses the antenna. This magnetic current, once determined, can be used to ascertain the near and the far fields. This method demonstrates that once the values of the electromagnetic field are known over an arbitrary geometry, its values for any other region can be obtained. An electric field integral equation is developed to relate the near fields to the equivalent magnetic current. A moment method procedure is employed to solve the integral equation by transforming it into a matrix equation. A least squares solution via singular value decomposition is used to solve the matrix equation. Computations with both synthetic and experimental data, where the near field of several antenna configurations are measured over various geometric surfaces, illustrate the accuracy of this method.

  abstract = {The {$\beta$}-galactosidase protein generated by the bacterial LacZ gene is widely used to map gene expression patterns. The ease of its use is only rivaled by green fluorescent protein, which can be used in combination with various other procedures such as immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, or tract tracing. The {$\beta$}-galactosidase enzymatic reaction provides potentially a more sensitive assay of gene expression than green fluorescent protein. However, the virtual impermeability and tendency to absorb light over a wide range limit the use of the most frequently used {$\beta$}-galactosidase substrate, X-Gal, in combination with other fluorescent labeling procedures. Here, we provide details on a simple photoactivation procedure that transforms the light-absorbing X-Gal product, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl (BCI) precipitate, into an intensely fluorescent product excited by 488 and 633 nm light. Photoactivation is achieved through exposure to 730 nm near-infrared light emitted from a femtosecond titanium-doped Sapphire laser. Photoactivation of BCI occurs in tissue sections suspended in buffered saline, glycerol, or even embedded in epoxy resin. A protocol for the use of BCI photoactivation is here provided. Importantly, the BCI photoactivated product is photoswitchable, displaying bistable photochromism. This permits the use of the fluorescent product in a variety of co-localization studies in conjunction with other imaging modalities. As with other bistable and photoswitchable products, the BCI reaction product shows concentration quenching at high density and can be degraded by continuous exposure to intense 730 nm illumination. Therefore, care must be taken in developing imaging strategies. Our findings have implications for the use of X-Gal in gene and protein detection and provide a novel substrate for high density digital information storage.},

  abstract = {Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.,  SARS-CoV2 causes epidemic pneumonia characterized by acute respiratory distress.This novel coronavirus is similar to SARS-CoV in sequence, pathogenesis, and cellular entry.Some coronaviruses can invade brainstem via a synapse-connected route from the lung and airways.The potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 may be one reason for the acute respiratory failure.Awareness of this will have guiding significance for the prevention and treatment.},

  abstract = {Microbial pathogens of respiratory infectious diseases are often transmitted through particles in sneeze and cough. Therefore, understanding the particle movement is important for infection control. Images of a sneeze induced by nasal cavity stimulation by healthy adult volunteers, were taken by a digital high-vision, high-speed video system equipped with a computer system and treated as a research model. The obtained images were enhanced electronically, converted to digital images every 1/300 s, and subjected to vector analysis of the bioparticles contained in the whole sneeze cloud using automatic image processing software. The initial velocity of the particles or their clusters in the sneeze was greater than 6 m/s, but decreased as the particles moved forward; the momentums of the particles seemed to be lost by 0.15\textendash 0.20 s and started a diffusion movement. An approximate equation of a function of elapsed time for their velocity was obtained from the vector analysis to represent the dynamics of the front-line particles. This methodology was also applied for a cough. Microclouds contained in a smoke exhaled with a voluntary cough by a volunteer after smoking one breath of cigarette, were traced as the visible, aerodynamic surrogates for invisible bioparticles of cough. The smoke cough microclouds had an initial velocity greater than 5 m/s. The fastest microclouds were located at the forefront of cloud mass that moving forward; however, their velocity clearly decreased after 0.05 s and they began to diffuse in the environmental airflow. The maximum direct reaches of the particles and microclouds driven by sneezing and coughing unaffected by environmental airflows were estimated by calculations using the obtained equations to be about 84 cm and 30 cm from the mouth, respectively, both achieved in about 0.2 s, suggesting that data relating to the dynamics of sneeze and cough became available by calculation.},

For the purpose of obtaining insulation materials with desirable dielectric and electrical resistance properties, we investigated several fillers with nonlinear electrical properties doped in silicon rubber composites, and their dependency on the temperature and field. The samples of silicone rubber composites with different components were prepared using barium strontium titanate (BST) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as the filler, and high temperature vulcanized silicone rubber (SiR) as the matrix. The investigations revealed that the BST-doped samples showed different dielectric properties compared to ZnO-doped composites, with an increase in the electric field, which was nonlinear. The resistivity of both doped samples was similar. Results demonstrated that it was possible to achieve higher values of permittivity, and lower values of tan{$\delta$} and resistivity, with respect to unfilled silicone rubber composites over a wide electrical field and temperature range. Discussion of the results attributes these important functional behaviours to the spontaneous polarization of nonlinear nanoparticles and the interaction between the SiR chains and the nonlinear nanoparticles at the interfacial area.},

The device exhibits low turn-on voltage of 7 V, stable current density of 2 {$\mu$}A per tip, and high transconductance of 1.7 {$\mu$}S per 100 tips field emitter array at V/sub AC/=22 V. An in situ vacuum encapsulation employing recessed cavities by isotropic RIE (reactive ion etch) method and an electron beam evaporated molybdenum vacuum seal are implemented to fabricate the new field emitter triode. The superb field emitter characteristics are probably due to sub-micron dimension device structure and the pencil type lateral cathode tip employing upper and lower LOCOS oxidation.},

None of the popular methods offer solutions for separation of a phage from another similar phage. We used affinity chromatography combined with competitive phage display (i) to purify T4 bacteriophage from bacterial debris and (ii) to separate T4 from other contaminating bacteriophages. In `competitive phage display' bacterial cells produced both wild types of the proteins (expression from the phage genome) and the protein fusions with affinity tags (expression from the expression vectors). Fusion proteins were competitively incorporated into the phage capsid. It allowed effective separation of T4 from a contaminating phage on standard affinity resins.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophage infection of starter cultures constitutes a major problem in the dairy fermentation industry, which may bring about important economic losses. In this study, a rapid detection method of bacteriophages was developed based on analysis of impedance changes occurred upon infection of a host-biofilm established onto metal microelectrodes. Bacteriophage PhiX174 and Escherichia coli WG5 were chosen as models for bacteriophage and host strain, respectively, because of their easiness of manipulation. Impedimetric changes occurring at the microelectrode surface, caused by bacteriophage infection and subsequent lysis of the host strain, were monitored over a 6-h period after the initial inoculation of phages by nonfaradic impedance spectroscopy (IS) in PBS and milk samples. Analysis of data was performed by two different approaches: (1) the equivalent circuit modelling theory, where a decrease in the magnitude of both the double layer and the biofilm capacitances due to the bacteriophage infection process was recorded, and (2) analysis of the impedance value, specially the impedance imaginary component (Zi) at selected frequencies. Zi is related to the capacitance of the circuit and also showed a decrease with respect to the control sample (without bacteriophages). The simplicity of the assay and the possibility of miniaturization of the system as well as its wide application, being able of detecting any bacteriophage as long as a suitable bacterial host is available, increase the number of applications to which this system could be used for.},

Performance characteristics of this applicator are compared with those of an identical structure having a flat corrugated disk at the aperture rim [1]. Also, the superiority of the proposed applicator in respect of improved beam symmetry and reduced edge-diffraction effect (leakage) is indicated. Experimental results on the near-field distributions in the principal planes of a test applicator are presented and are compared with relevant results obtained from a flat-disk loaded applicator [1] of identical dimensions. Also, to get improved input VSWR performance (VSWR less than 1.6), off-setting the corrugated disk (flat or curved) behind the aperture is suggested and is also demonstrated experimentally. Furthermore, as a design flexibility and to simplify fabrication, filling the corrugation grooves with a suitable dielectric material is suggested and explained. Lastly, the feasibility of using a simple corrugated circular waveguide as an alternative direct-contact type of applicator is discussed.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence imaging and analysis techniques have become ubiquitous in life science research, and they are poised to play an equally vital role in in vitro diagnostics (IVD) in the future. Optical filters are crucial for nearly all fluorescence microscopes and instruments, not only to provide the obvious function of spectral control, but also to ensure the highest possible detection sensitivity and imaging resolution. Filters make it possible for the sample to ``see'' light within only the absorption band, and the detector to ``see'' light within only the emission band. Without filters, the detector would not be able to distinguish the desired fluorescence from scattered excitation light and autofluorescence from the sample, substrate, and other optics in the system. Today the vast majority of fluorescence instruments, including the widely popular fluorescence microscope, use thin-film interference filters to control the spectra of the excitation and emission light. Hence, this unit emphasizes thin-film filters. After briefly introducing different types of thin-film filters and how they are made, the unit describes in detail different optical filter configurations in fluorescence instruments, including both single-color and multicolor imaging systems. Several key properties of thin-film filters, which can significantly affect optical system performance, are then described. In the final section, tunable optical filters are also addressed in a relative comparison. Curr. Protoc. Cytom. 56:2.4.1-2.4.25. \textcopyright{} 2011 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Prior opto-mechanical techniques to measure vibrational frequencies of viruses work on large ensembles of particles, whereas, in this work, individually trapped viral particles were studied. Double nanohole (DNH) apertures in a gold film were used to achieve optical trapping of one of the smallest virus particles yet reported, PhiX174, which has a diameter of 25 nm. When a laser was focused onto these DNH apertures, it created high local fields due to plasmonic enhancement, which allowed stable trapping of small particles for prolonged periods at low powers. Two techniques were performed to characterize the virus particles. The particles were sized via an established autocorrelation analysis technique, and the acoustic modes were probed using the extraordinary acoustic Raman (EAR) method. The size of the trapped particle was determined to be 25 \&plusmn; 3.8 nm, which is in good agreement with the established diameter of PhiX174. A peak in the EAR signal was observed at 32 GHz, which fits well with the predicted value from elastic theory.},

The key device in the system is the two-port phase modulator, which functions, in conjunction with a dispersive element in the loop, to form a high-Q microwave filter to perform microwave frequency selection. The central frequency of the microwave filter is a function of the optical wavelength and the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive element, therefore, the oscil-lation frequency can be simply tuned by tuning the wavelength of the laser source or the chromatic dispersion of the dispersive ele-ment. A theoretical analysis is provided, which is verified by exper-iments. The phase noise performance and the frequency tunability are both experimentally investigated.

The phase and amplitude control of power deposition patterns for this system have been theoretically analyzed at a frequency of 200 MHz. The formulas for calculating the electric field (E-field) and specific absorption rate (SAR) for this APA system have been derived and can be applied to other types of APA systems. Models on computerized tomography (CT) scans from liver and lung regions have been used for predicting optimization of the E-field and SAR patterns in the case of the relative phase and amplitude changes. It is shown that the phase and amplitude control of SAR patterns results in a more selective and effective heating of tumors situated eccentrically and deeply within the body. The numerical results indicate that it is possible to shift the absorbed power patterns by electrically varying the phase and/or the amplitude of the sources and manually moving the positions of the horns.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Two main groups of flow distributors, viz. ``bifurcating distributors'' (BF) and ``radially interconnected distributors'' (RI), as well as some hybrid distributors were investigated. Computational fluid dynamics was used to evaluate the performance of the distributors and to establish the design yielding the most uniform velocity field and the smallest variance for the bands emerging from the distributor. A minimum channel width of 100 ␮m was considered to allow the use of micro-milling techniques for chip fabrication. The main factors that influenced the values of band variances were identified. The performance of the distributors was found to correlate most strongly with the volume of the flow distributors. The separation bed should be positioned immediately after, but not against the flow distributor. It was concluded that BF distributors perform best in terms of band variance. The values of band variances for the BF distributor decreased with increasing angle between bifurcation branches and the lowest value of about 0.01 mm2 was found for \k{} = 175{$\smwhtcircle$}. Both BF and RI flow distributors were found to perform reasonably well when imperfections were present in the structure. However, severe blockages (exceeding 75\% of the cross-sectional area and length) of channels in, especially, BF flow distributors may jeopardize their performance.},

Of these, a mere 10,733 phages have been isolated and 2,061 phages have sequenced, complete genomes, with even fewer, only 1,073, presently publicly available in the NCBI GenBank database. ``Phagehunting'' is the process of isolation, characterization, and genomic analyses of phages that infect bacterial hosts. There is considerable interest in using phages as diagnostics and therapeutics of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. One such MDR bacterium is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, whose phages can be isolated on the easy-to-grow non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. Since current phagehunting procedures of Mycobacterium phages all use identical plating conditions, we would like to explore alternative phagehunting procedures to determine if that affects the type of phages isolated. To date, no phages within the Podoviridae family have been isolated that infect Mycobacteria. With these new optimized procedures, we would like to pilot a program, contingent on the success of this study, to expose high school students to the field of molecular and synthetic genomics. We examined the precise conditions required in each step of the phagehunting process to successfully obtain phage. With the use of careful phage isolation procedures and environmental samples from various locations, such as alternative media usage and modified plaque-picking methods, we isolated potentially novel phages. One of these phages, Kalon1, has been isolated and preliminarily characterized. The success of this study may provide the foundation for an improved program for high school students to foster their interest in research and gain invaluable experiences outside of the classroom while providing bacteriophages that can serve as the base chassis of synthetically engineered phages for diagnosis and treatment of MDR pathogens. Lastly, by creating a generalizable standardized process to obtain phages, we may broaden the horizon for new exploration of novel phages and advances in phage therapy of any MDR pathogen.},

Induction of Fab expression imposed a metabolic load on the recombinant cells, resulting in lower final cell yields compared to the non-induced controls. An IPTG concentration of 0.05 mM was sufficient to achieve maximal expression of soluble Fab protein when inducing in the early-, mid-, or late-log phases of batch cultures grown using either glucose or glycerol as a carbon source. The largest overall yield of Fab fragments when using 0.05 mM IPTG was achieved by increasing the final yield of cells through glycerol feeding following induction in late-log phase. Lactose was as effective as IPTG for inducing Fab expression in E. coli RB791/pComb3. The greatest overall level of Fab expression was found when cells grown on glycerol were induced with 2 g/L lactose in late-log phase. Since the cost of 0.05 mM of IPTG is significantly greater than the cost of 2 g/L lactose, lactose provides an inexpensive alternative to IPTG for inducing the expression of Fab fragments, and possibly other recombinant proteins, from the E. coli lac promoter.},

  abstract = {We previously identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS-CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS-CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS-CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS. SARS-CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle. These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS-CoV may also be targets of SARS-CoV infection. The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS-CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS-CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways. This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of pNPP liberating inorganic phosphate and the conjugate base of para-nitrophenol (pNP). The resulting phenolate is  yellow, with a maximal absorption at 405 nm. This property can be used to determine the activity of various phosphatases including alkaline phosphatase (AP) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). The substance is sensitive to light, and thus should be stored protected from light. This is also important after adding the substrate to the mixture and before reading. -20\textdegree C is the optimal storage temperature.},

  abstract = {A major limitation with traditional phage preparations is the variability in titer, salts, and bacterial contaminants between successive propagations. Here we introduce the Phage On Tap (PoT) protocol for the quick and efficient preparation of homogenous bacteriophage (phage) stocks. This method produces homogenous, laboratory-scale, high titer (up to 1010\textendash 11 PFU{$\cdot$}ml-1), endotoxin reduced phage banks that can be used to eliminate the variability between phage propagations and improve the molecular characterizations of phage. The method consists of five major parts, including phage propagation, phage clean up by 0.22 {$\mu$}m filtering and chloroform treatment, phage concentration by ultrafiltration, endotoxin removal, and the preparation and storage of phage banks for continuous laboratory use. From a starting liquid lysate of {$>$} 100 mL, the PoT protocol generated a clean, homogenous, laboratory phage bank with a phage recovery efficiency of 85\% within just two days. In contrast, the traditional method took upwards of five days to produce a high titer, but lower volume phage stock with a recovery efficiency of only 4\%. Phage banks can be further purified for the removal of bacterial endotoxins, reducing endotoxin concentrations by over 3,000-fold while maintaining phage titer. The PoT protocol focused on T-like phages, but is broadly applicable to a variety of phages that can be propagated to sufficient titer, producing homogenous, high titer phage banks that are applicable for molecular and cellular assays.},

  abstract = {For a bacteriophage to be useful for phage therapy it must be both isolated from the environment and shown to have certain characteristics beyond just killing strains of the target bacterial pathogen. These include desirable characteristics such as a relatively broad host range and a lack of other characteristics such as carrying toxin genes and the ability to form a lysogen. While phages are commonly isolated first and subsequently characterized, it is possible to alter isolation procedures to bias the isolation toward phages with desirable characteristics. Some of these variations are regularly used by some groups while others have only been shown in a few publications. In this review I will describe (1) isolation procedures and variations that are designed to isolate phages with broader host ranges, (2) characterization procedures used to show that a phage may have utility in phage therapy, including some of the limits of such characterization, and (3) results of a survey and discussion with phage researchers in industry and academia on the practice of characterization of phages.},

It is shown that when phase shifters are used within the architecture of the array, the focal point moves as a function of frequency, which degrades the focusing performance of the antenna. To mitigate these limitations, time-delay units are proposed, and it is revealed that perfect focusing across a wide bandwidth can be achieved by this approach. To validate this concept, an UWB Vivaldi focused antenna array using time delays is designed which demonstrates good focusing capability across the UWB spectrum.},

A phased array of contacting radiators is proposed for overcoming the difficulty of selective heating within the body cavity caused primarily by the muscle layer. The field from one aperture radiator in contact with layered tissue is predicted by a planar spectral diffraction algorithm incorporating transmission and reflection operations on the plane wave spectrum. This prediction process is validated by experimental results. The algorithm enables the prediction of a minimum number of phased contacting radiators required for selective heating within lung tissue through fat and muscle layers at 2.45 GHz, and provides a guide for the design requirements of a multiapplicator system.},

The fluorescence signal was detected by a photomultiplier tube and was fed into a versatile digital oscilloscope. The phase difference between the fluorescence signal and the reference signal obtained from a diffusion plate was directly read out using the operational functions of the digital oscilloscope. To demonstrate the system performance, fluorescence lifetimes of 25 ppm rhodamine 6G in ethanol and of 10 ppm quinine sulfate in 0.1 N H2SO4 were measured. The calculated lifetimes of 5.8 ns and 19.1 ns, respectively, agreed with those reported in the literature. The combination of the UV LED and the digital oscilloscope made the fluorometer simple and easy to construct with low cost.},

  abstract = {A decrease in the apparent pseudo first-order rate constant is observed in the photocatalyzed (TiO2) degradation of surfactant Triton X-100 (Triton) when its concentration is increased. The measured rate versus the concentration profile is consistent with a hyperbolic form (rate increases with concentration) as described by the Langmuir\textendash Hinshelwood (L-H) model. The rate is then given by the expression: r = kK[Triton]/(1 + K[Triton]) but the apparent rate constant by kapp = kK/(1 + K[Triton]o), where k = 0.66 mg L-1 min-1 and K = 0.037 L mg-1. Therefore, at low [Triton]o, kapp = kK but at high [Triton]o, kapp = k/[Triton]o, that is, an inverse function of the reactant concentration. Although, in the latter case the reaction does not follow first-order kinetics, its pseudo first-order deviation is not easily noticeable. Therefore, this decrease in kapp with reactant concentration may limit its use when rate constants are compared to evaluate degradation efficiency or when it is used to show reaction inhibition. However, we have detected p-nitrophenol inhibition induced by Triton using kapp values. Inhibition is observed at [Triton]o {$<$} CMC (critical micelle concentration) and also at [Triton]o {$>$} CMC. These inhibitions are consistent with the LH model given by the expression: r = k{${'}$}K{${'}$}[phenol]/(1 + K{${'}$}[phenol]o + K[Triton]o), where [phenol] is equal during all kinetic runs.

The problems of thermometry in the presence of electromagnetic fields fall outside the scope of this article. Their solution, however, is no less important to the future of clinical hyperthermia than the development of heating techniques.

A digitally generated pulse is decomposed by the NLTL into several impulse waves called solitons. Finally, the secondary solitons are degenerated by means of tapering. In this way, the compression effect is achieved. The simulation results showed that the narrowest pulse generated by the delay line-based pulse generator circuit was 37ps. Following that, the NLTL further compressed the pulse by 62\% to 14 ps. Hence, an extremely wide bandwidth from 0 to a first null of 100GHz was generated.

  abstract = {Centrifugal microfluidics has emerged as a unique approach to the development of integrated total analysis systems for medical diagnostics. However, despite its many advantages, the platform has a size limitation due to the centripetal pumping mechanism in which fluids can only be moved from the center of the disc to the rim. This limits the footprint of the microfluidic network to one radius of the disc, and this in turn limits the amount of space available to embed complex assays. In order to overcome this space limitation problem, we are developing new techniques to pump fluids back toward the center of the disc as to allow greater path lengths for the fluidic network. This study presents a novel pumping mechanism for centrifugal microfluidics utilizing a combination of centrifugation and pneumatic compression. Pneumatic energy is stored during high-speed centrifugation with sample fluids trapping then compressing air in specially designed chambers. The accumulated pneumatic energy is released by spinning down, which expands the trapped air and thus pumps liquids back toward the center of the CD. This newly developed method overcomes current limitations of centripetal pumping avoiding external manipulation or surface treatments. In this article, we explore the design of appropriate chambers to induce pneumatic pumping and analytically describe the mechanics behind the pumping action. For proof of principle, we have applied pneumatic pumping to siphon priming.},

  abstract = {Using polymer materials to fabricate microfluidic devices provides simple, cost effective, and disposal advantages for both lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices and micro total analysis systems (\textmu TAS). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer and thermoplastics are the two major polymer materials used in microfluidics. The fabrication of PDMS and thermoplastic microfluidic device can be categorized as front-end polymer microchannel fabrication and post-end microfluidic bonding procedures, respectively. PDMS and thermoplastic materials each have unique advantages and their use is indispensable in polymer microfluidics. Therefore, the proper selection of polymer microfabrication is necessary for the successful application of microfluidics. In this paper, we give a short overview of polymer microfabrication methods for microfluidics and discuss current challenges and future opportunities for research in polymer microfluidics fabrication. We summarize standard approaches, as well as state-of-art polymer microfluidic fabrication methods. Currently, the polymer microfluidic device is at the stage of technology transition from research labs to commercial production. Thus, critical consideration is also required with respect to the commercialization aspects of fabricating polymer microfluidics. This article provides easy-to-understand illustrations and targets to assist the research community in selecting proper polymer microfabrication strategies in microfluidics.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown the applicability of nonlinear transmission lines (NLTLs) in high speed and wide bandwidth systems. These applications involve techniques for forming and sharpening a short electrical pulse to achieve pulse compressors, frequency multipliers, phase shifters, and, in addition, radio frequency (RF) generation, holding, in this case, a great potential for replacing vacuum electron tubes with a low cost and fully solid-state technology. Based on the analysis of relevant experimental results of different types of NLTLs reported in the literature, this paper presents an investigation about the correlation between the performance limits of NLTLs and specific characteristics of the materials used in their construction, concluding that there is a pressing demand for the development of high-performance dielectric and magnetic materials with special characteristics such as highly nonlinear behavior, low losses at microwave frequencies, and thermal stability that would allow for an improvement in the performance of NLTLs, enabling their operation at higher frequencies and with better electrical-to-RF conversion efficiency. The achievement of a stable behavior over a broader operating temperature range would allow the application of NLTLs in military and aerospace devices.},

One of the most important properties computed for a transmission line is its characteristic impedance, which is often used in the extraction of the equivalent circuit model of an interconnection discontinuity. The calculation of the characteristic impedance from FDTD numerical results seems to be trivial it can simply be obtained by the ratio of the Fourier transformed voltage and the Fourier transformed current. However, it is shown that, if the characteristic impedance is not calculated properly, significant amount of error can be introduced in its numerical solution.},

The optical pulses are plane waves that begin propagating as amplitude modulated signals with given carrier frequencies and modulation functions. Closed form analytic approximations that describe the dynamics of the pulses for sufficiently large values of the propagation distance Z for all time t are given. The results describe the dynamics of the precursors and the signal and show the effects introduced by the interaction of these fields. Results show that (1) the velocity of propagation of the signal does not peak to the vacuum speed of light for signal frequencies in the absorption band of the medium, as was obtained by Brillouin; (2) under certain conditions, the signal is broken up into two parts that are separated by Brillouin's precursor; and (3) there is a relationship between the velocity of propagation of the signal and the velocity of propagation of energy in a monochromatic field with the same frequency as the signal carrier frequency.},

The isoelectric point, the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry and X-ray protein crystallography. The database, available at http://isoelectricpointdb.org allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customised fractions of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover, Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life. For instance, using Proteome-pI data, it is clear that Eukaryotes, which evolved tight control of homeostasis, encode proteins with pI values near the cell pH. In contrast, Archaea living frequently in extreme environments can possess proteins with a wide range of isoelectric points. The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. Apart from data for individual proteomes, datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated and made available in CSV format.},

  abstract = {Pulse sharpening effects in ferrite transmission lines may be used to obtain kV pulses with ns risetime. The exact description of the sharpening effect requires complex shock wave analysisl. In this paper an approximate but useful physical model is discussed. The ferrite is treated as a lossy but linear transmission line from which equivalent design results are obtained. In many instances the nonlinear effects present are confined to a region which is small compared to the total transmission length, which makes the linear approximation more plausible. Preliminary experimental results, based on a 130 em long line, are in accord with the predictions of the model.},

  abstract = {Dengue virus is a flavivirus responsible for millions of infections per year. Its surface contains a phospholipid bilayer, within which are embedded the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, arranged with icosahedral geometry. Exposure to low pH triggers the E proteins to undergo conformational changes, which precede fusion with the host cell membrane and release of the viral genome. The flavivirus membrane exhibits significant local curvature and deformation, as revealed by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), but its precise structure and interactions with envelope components remain unclear. We now report simulations of the dengue viral particle that refine its envelope structure in unprecedented detail. Our final models are morphologically consistent with cryo-EM data, and reveal the structural basis for membrane curvature. Electrostatic interactions increased envelope complex stability; this coupling has potential functional significance in the context of the viral fusion mechanism and infective states.},

In this study, we demonstrate the quantification of the number of bacterial cells based on the autofluorescence from the cell lysate on a microfluidic chip. We tested three model pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes F4244, Salmonella Enteritidis PT1 and Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL 933). In the experiment, a plug of {$\sim$}150 pL containing lysate from 240 to 4100 cells was injected into a microfluidic channel with downstream laser-induced fluorescence detection under electrophoresis conditions. We found that the autofluorescence intensity increased with the number of cells almost linearly for all three bacteria. The autofluorescence remained a single peak when the cell lysate contained a mixture of different bacterial species. We also demonstrate a simple microfluidic device that integrates entrapment and electrical lysis of bacterial cells with fluorescence detection. Such a device can carry out the quantification of bacterial cells based on lysate autofluorescence without off-chip procedures. This study offers a simple and fast solution to on-chip quantification of bacterial cells without labeling. We believe that the method can be extended to other bacterial species.},

Although many methods have been developed to measure quantity attributes of AAV, they are often technically challenging and time consuming. Here we report a method to titer AAV with GelGreen\textregistered{} dye, a safe green fluorescence nucleic acid dye recently engineered by Biotium company (Fremont, CA). This method, hereinafter referred to as GelGreen method, provides a fast (\textasciitilde{} 30 minutes) and reliable strategy for AAV titration. To validate GelGreen method, we measured genome titer of an AAV reference material AAV8RSM and compared our titration results with those determined by Reference Material Working Group (ARMWG). We showed that GelGreen results and capsid Elisa results are comparable to each other. We also showed that GelRed\textregistered{} dye, a red fluorescence dye from Biotium, can be used to directly ``visualize'' AAV genome titer on a conventional gel imager, presenting an especially direct approach to estimate viral quantity. In summary, we described a technique to titer AAV by using new generation of safe DNA dyes. This technique is simple, safe, reliable and cost-efficient. It has potential to be broadly applied for quantifying and normalizing AAV viral vectors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Anticipating the quantum internet, here we show under reasonable model assumptions a polynomial quantum speedup of Godwin's law. Concretely, in quantum discussions, Hitler will be mentioned on average quadratically earlier, and we conjecture that under specific network topologies, even cubic speedups are possible. We also show that the speedup cannot be more than exponential, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a certain finite level. We report on numerical experiments to simulate the appearance of the quantum Godwin law in future quantum internets; the most amazing finding of our studies is that -- unlike quantum computational speedups -- the quantum Godwin effect is not only robust against noise, but actually enhanced by decoherence. We have as yet no theoretical explanation, nor a good application, for this astonishing behaviour, which we dub quantum hyperpiesia.},

Resolutions of .0001 \textdegree C, and accuracy of .02 \textdegree C from 0-100 \textdegree C are achievable. The high linearity makes it possible to achieve high accuracy over an important temperature range that contains only one convenient temperature reference point for calibration, the triple point of water. Introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1965, the successor company, Agilent, has discontinued the Model 2804A Quartz Thermometer. Other manufacturers make nearly linear-in-temperature quartz crystals that may be used to construct thermometers of similar performance.},

  abstract = {With increasing complexities and shrinking size of modern electronic devices, the near-field RF interference issues are becoming challenging for RF-digital mixed circuit design. Predicting the coupling from digital module to RF antennas and mitigating RF interference is important to the system performance. The ultimate goal of this study is to address the desensitization issues existing in modern electronic devices that have mixed high speed digital-RF circuits, such as cellphone and wearable devices. In order to estimate the near-field noise coupling from digital module to RF antennas, the noise source is anticipated to be replaced by its equivalent radiation model which can facilitate the near-field coupling analysis. This thesis focuses on modeling of radiation noise source and its application in RF interference applications. Two methods are proposed, equivalent dipole moment model and Huygens's equivalent model. The methodology of both methods will be introduced and later validated with full-wave simulation and measurement. Dipole moment model is extracted by Least-square and improved with global optimization, while Huygens's equivalent model is constructed in full-wave simulation tool. With equivalent noise source model, the near-field coupling between radiation noise source and RF antennas are estimated by either direct simulation or reciprocity theorem. Field data is obtained by near-field scanning with phase information. Measurement data shows good correlation and consistence for noise source modeling and near-field coupling.},

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has caused over 550,000 deaths worldwide as of July 2020. Accurate and scalable point-of-care devices would increase screening, diagnosis, and monitoringof COVID-19 patients. Here, we demonstrate rapid label-free electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a commercially available impedance sensing platform. A 16-well plate containing sensing electrodes was pre-coated with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and subsequently tested with samples of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody CR3022 (0.1 \textmu g/ml, 1.0 \textmu g/ml, 10 \textmu g/ml). Subsequent blinded testing was performed on six serum specimens taken from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (1:100 dilution factor). The platform was able to differentiate spikes in impedance measurements from a negative control (1\% milk solution) for all CR3022 samples. Further, successful differentiation and detection of all positive clinical samples from negative control was achieved. Measured impedance values were consistent when compared to standard ELISA test results showing a strong correlation between them (R2 = 0.9). Detection occurs in less than five minutes and the well-based platform provides a simplified and familiar testing interface that can be readily adaptable for use in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Using panicum mosaic virus (PMV) and several St. Augustine decline strains of PMV (SAD) as test viruses, previously developed procedures of agarose gel electrophoresis (reviewed in P. Serwer, Electrophoresis 1983, 3, 375\textendash 382) have been used for the first time to detect and characterize plant viruses. PMV and some SAD strains produce two particles that copurify during rate zonal sedimentation, but form separate bands during agarose gel electrophoresis (forms 1 and 2). By measuring electrophoretic mobility ({$\mu$}) as a function of agarose percentage and correcting for electroosmosis, it was found that: (a) form 1 has a solid support-free {$\mu$} ({$\mu$}0) different from the {$\mu$}0 of form 2, and (b) forms 1 and 2 have the same radius (14.6 {$\pm$} 0.6nm). Form 1 is indistinguishable from form 2 by either electron microscopy or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The {$\mu$}0 of form 1 and the relative amount of forms 1 and 2 vary with the virus strain and can be used to help identify strains. A previously described satellite of PMV and some SAD strains also has two forms. The radius of the satellite of one SAD strain was found to be 7.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 nm. A procedure of differential gel staining was developed for distinguishing the 14.6 nm virus from its 7.6 nm satellite. After agarose gel electrophoresis of either totally unfractionated or partially fractionated, infected grass extracts, virus particles wer detected without interference from host components. The procedures used here should be useful for rapid disease diagnosis and strain typing of the above and possibly other plant viruses.},

  abstract = {Wild-type T4 bacteriophage and recombinant reporter lac Z T4 bacteriophage carrying the {$\beta$}-galactosidase gene were used for detection of generic Escherichia coli by monitoring the release of {$\beta$}-galactosidase upon phage-mediated cell lysis. The reaction was performed on a paper-based portable culture device to limit the diffusion of reagents and, hence, increase the sensitivity of the assay, and to avoid handling large sample volumes, making the assay suitable for on-site analysis. Chromogenic (chlorophenol red-{$\beta$}-d-galactopyranoside, CPRG) and bioluminescent (6-O-{$\beta$}-galactopyranosyl-luciferin, Beta-Glo\textregistered ) {$\beta$}-galactosidase substrates were tested in the assay. Water samples were first filtered through 0.45-{$\mu$}m pore size filters to concentrate bacteria. The filters were then placed into the paper-based device containing nutrient medium and incubated at 37~\textdegree C for 4~h. Bacteriophage with the respective indicator substrate was added to the device, and signal (color, luminescence) development was recorded with a digital camera, luminometer, or luminescence imaging device. It was demonstrated that as low as 40 or {$<$}10~colony-forming units (cfu)\,ml-1 of E. coli can be detected visually within 8~h when wild-type T4 bacteriophage or recombinant lacZ T4 bacteriophage were used in the assay, respectively. Application of the bioluminescent {$\beta$}-galactosidase substrate allowed reliable detection of {$<$}10~cfu~ml-1 within 5.5~h. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated using a panel of microorganisms including Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, and Salmonella Typhimurium.},

  abstract = {Phage-based detection assays have been developed for the detection of viable bacteria for applications in clinical diagnosis, monitoring of water quality, and food safety. The majority of these assays deliver a positive readout in the form of newly generated progeny phages by the bacterial host of interest. Progeny phages are often visualized as plaques, or holes, in a lawn of bacteria on an agar-filled Petri dish; however, this rate-limiting step requires up to 12 h of incubation time. We have previously described an amplification of bacteriophages M13 inside droplets of media suspended in perfluorinated oil; a single phage M13 in a droplet yields 107 copies in 3\textendash 4 h. Here, we describe that encapsulation of reporter phages, both lytic T4-LacZ and nonlytic M13, in monodisperse droplets can also be used for rapid enumeration of phage. Compartmentalization in droplets accelerated the development of the signal from the reporter enzyme; counting of ``positive'' droplets yields accurate enumeration of phage particles ranging from 102 to 106 pfu/mL. For enumeration of T4-LacZ phage, the fluorescent signal appeared in as little as 90 min. Unlike bulk assays, quantification in emulsion is robust and insensitive to fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., temperature). Power-free emulsification using gravity-driven flow in the absence of syringe pumps and portable fluorescence imaging solutions makes this technology promising for use at the point of care in low-resource environments. This droplet-based phage enumeration method could accelerate and simplify point-of-care detection of the pathogens for which reporter bacteriophages have been developed.},

The increasing frequency and magnitude of viral outbreaks in recent decades has resulted in an urgent need for diagnostic methods that are facile, sensitive, rapid and inexpensive. Here, we describe and characterise a novel, calcium-mediated interaction of the surface of enveloped viruses with DNA, that can be used for the functionalisation of intact virus particles via chemical groups attached to the DNA. Using DNA modified with fluorophores, we have demonstrated the rapid and sensitive labelling and detection of influenza and other viruses using single-particle tracking and particle-size determination. With this method, we have detected clinical isolates of influenza in just one minute, significantly faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests. This powerful technique is easily extendable to a wide range of other enveloped pathogenic viruses and holds significant promise as a future diagnostic tool.},

Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 \texttimes{} 101 pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 \texttimes{} 102 copies/mL). Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling.},

We report a case of COVID-19 infection in a 64-year-old man who developed rapidly worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that required intubation. As the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection ranges from mild illness to ARDS with high mortality risk, there is need for research that identifies early markers of disease severity. Current evidence suggests that patients with advanced age, dyspnoea or pre-existing comorbidities should be monitored closely, especially at 1\textendash 2 weeks after symptom onset. It remains to be seen whether laboratory findings such as lymphopaenia or elevated lactate dehydrogenase may serve as early surrogates for critical illness or markers of disease recovery. Management of ARDS in COVID-19 patients remains supportive while we await results of drug trials. More studies are needed to understand the incidence and outcomes of ARDS and critical illness from COVID-19 infection which are important for critical care management of patients and resource planning.},

  abstract = {Context: ALMA observations of Venus at 267 GHz have been presented in the literature that show the apparent presence of phosphine (PH3) in its atmosphere. Phosphine has currently no evident production routes on the planet's surface or in its atmosphere. Aims: The aim of this work is to assess the statistical reliability of the line detection by independent re-analysis of the ALMA data. Methods: The ALMA data were reduced as in the published study, following the provided scripts. First the spectral analysis presented in the study was reproduced and assessed. Subsequently, the spectrum was statistically evaluated, including its dependence on selected ALMA baselines. Results: We find that the 12th-order polynomial fit to the spectral passband utilised in the published study leads to spurious results. Following their recipe, five other {$>$}10 sigma lines can be produced in absorption or emission within 60 km/s from the PH3 1-0 transition frequency by suppressing the surrounding noise. Our independent analysis shows a feature near the PH3 frequency at a \textasciitilde 2 sigma level, below the common threshold for statistical significance. Since the spectral data have a non-Gaussian distribution, we consider a feature at such level as statistically unreliable that cannot be linked to a false positive probability. Conclusions: We find that the published 267-GHz ALMA data provide no statistical evidence for phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus.},

The polarization diversities among linear polarization (LP), right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) are also obtained by switching three PIN diodes on the slot and the truncating corners of a square patch on and off. The antenna design and experimental results are presented.},

  abstract = {We have designed, fabricated, and tested a low cost tunable narrow pico-pulse generator using a 60ps transition time step-recovery diode (SRD) device. Both the pulse duration and shape are electronically controllable using PIN diodes that are optimally connected in series. A simple concept of an input-matching network was developed and implemented that can significantly minimize pulse broadening and suppress pulse distortion. The developed pulse generator circuit has a wide adjustable pulse duration covering a 300ps to 1ns range and produces either monocycle or Gaussian pulses using novel pulse shaping circuitry. The proposed structure can be easily reconfigured to include more complicated pulse shapes such as polycycle signals.},

The oscillator consists of a nonlinear transmission line (NLTL), one end of which is connected to a one-port amplifier and the other end is open. In the steady state, a self-generated short-duration pulse travels back and forth on the NLTL, reflected at both ends of the NLTL due to impedance mismatches. The one-port amplifier produces a negative output resistance for a voltage beyond a particular threshold and a positive output resistance for a voltage below that threshold, and thus, the reflection from the amplifier provides gain for the main upper portion of the pulse to compensate loss, and attenuates small perturbations to ensure oscillation stability. The NLTL substantially sharpens the pulse.},

We analyze the influence of absorption on the visibility of interferometric fringes and, accordingly, on the measurement of the refractive index. Further, we show that the refractive index in the absorption band can be retrieved by a two-step process. The procedure requires the use of two samples of different thickness, the thicker one to retrieve the refractive index in the transparent region and the thinnest to obtain the data in the absorption region. First, the refractive index values are retrieved with good accuracy in the transparent region of the material for 1-mm-thick samples. Second, these refractive index values serve also to precisely calculate the thickness of a thinner sample (\textasciitilde 150 \textmu m) since the accuracy of the methods depends strongly on the thickness of the sample. Finally, the refractive index is recovered for the entire spectral range. \textcopyright{} 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement OCIS codes: (120.4530) Optical constants; (260.2030) Dispersion; (120.3180) Interferometry; (120.6200) Spectrometers and spectroscopic instrumentation.},

Ventilation-perfusion ratios at nine levels of the lung have been calculated and differences in local gas exchange deduced. In the resulting model, alveolar O               2               tension changes by more than 40 mm Hg from apex to base while CO               2               and N               2               tensions change by about 14 and 29 mm Hg, respectively.

The results indicate the presence of one large subunit of DNA (molecular weight 45 x 106) for each former phage particle. Some smaller subunits of molecular weight 12 x 106 have been observed. The large subunit is sensitive to very small amounts of DNAase, and is resistant to mixed proteases and cannot be dispersed by banding in cesium chloride density gradients. The sensitivity to fragmentation by P32 decay and the increase in this sensitivity following heat treatment are best explained by assuming that the large subunit is a duplex of polynucleotide strands over most of its length. The presence of hypothetical non-DNA interconnections is considered.},

  abstract = {High-power microwaves are used to inhibit electronics of threatening military or civilian vehicles. This work aims to assess health hazards of high-power microwaves and helps to define hazard threshold levels of modulated radiofrequency exposures such as those emitted by the first generations of mobile phones. Rats were exposed to the highest possible field levels, under single acute or repetitive exposures for eight weeks. Intense microwave electric fields at 1 MV m-1 of nanoseconds duration were applied from two sources at different carrier frequencies of 10 and 3.7 GHz. The repetition rate was 100 pps, and the duration of train pulses lasted from 10 s to twice 8 min. The effects on the central nervous system were evaluated, by labelling brain inflammation marker GFAP and by performing different behavioural tests: rotarod, T-maze, beam-walking, open-field, and avoidance test. Long-time survival was measured in animals repeatedly exposed, and anatomopathological analysis was performed on animals sacrificed at two years of life or earlier in case of precocious death. Control groups were sham exposed. Few effects were observed on behaviour. With acute exposure, an avoidance reflex was shown at very high thermal level (22 W kg-1); GFAP was increased some days after exposure. Most importantly, with repeated exposures, survival time was 4-months shorter in the exposed group, with eleven animals exhibiting a large sub-cutaneous tumour, compared to two in the sham group. A residual X-ray exposure was also present in the beam (0.8 Gy), which is probably not a bias for the observed result. High power microwaves below thermal level in average, can increase cancer prevalence and decrease survival time in rats, without clear effects on behaviour. The parameters of this effect need to be further explored, and a more precise dosimetry to be performed.},

  abstract = {In this letter, we treat a rod-shaped virus as a free homogenous nanorod and identify its confined acoustic vibration modes that can cause strong resonant microwave absorption through electric dipolar excitation with a core-shell charge distribution. They are found to be the n\,=\,4N-2 modes of the longitudinal modes of the nanorods, where N is an integer starting from 1 and n is the mode order quantum number. This study was confirmed by measuring the microwave absorption spectra of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), which is a rod-shaped virus. This is also the first study to identify the ``dipolar-like'' mode in a rod-shaped nano-object. Our study is not only an important step to achieve rapid and sensitive detection of rod-shaped viruses based on their microwave spectroscopic features and a non-contact method to measure the Young's modulus of rod-shaped viruses, but also is critical to formulate an efficient epidemic prevention strategy to deactivate viruses with the structure-resonant microwaves.},

While only a small percentage of patients require mechanical ventilation and ICU care, the enormous size of the populations affected means that these critical resources may become limited. A number of non-invasive options exist to avert mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. This is a clinical review of these options and their applicability in adult COVID-19 patients. Summary recommendations include: (1) Avoid nebulized therapies. Consider metered dose inhaler alternatives. (2) Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure. Maintain awareness of the aerosol-generating potential of all devices, including nasal cannulas, simple face masks, and venturi masks. Use non-rebreather masks when possible. Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment. (3) High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission. If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation. (4) Early intubation/mechanical ventilation may be prudent for patients deemed likely to progress to critical illness, multi-organ failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).},

  abstract = {The biological effects of modulated radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields have been a subject of debate since early publications more than 30 years ago, suggesting that relatively weak amplitude-modulated RF electromagnetic fields have specific biological effects different from the well-known thermal effects of RF energy. This discussion has been recently activated by the increasing human exposure to RF fields from wireless communication systems. Modulation is used in all wireless communication systems to enable the signal to carry information. A previous review in 1998 indicated that experimental evidence for modulation-specific effects of RF energy is weak. This article reviews recent studies (published after 1998) on the biological effects of modulated RF fields. The focus is on studies that have compared the effects of modulated and unmodulated (continuous wave) RF fields, or compared the effects of different kinds of modulations; studies that used only one type of signal are not included. While the majority of recent studies have reported no modulation-specific effects, there are a few interesting exceptions indicating that there may be specific effects from amplitude-modulated RF fields on the human central nervous system. These findings warrant follow-up studies. Bioelectromagnetics 32:511\textendash 534, 2011. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To reach watt-level output power from a single-chip CMOS PA, two main strategies can be identified: use of high supply voltage, and use of matching and power combination. High supply voltage limits are closely related to device design in the fabrication process. However, the maximum operating voltage can be improved by amplifier class selection, circuit solutions, and process modifications or mask changes. High output power can also be reached by the use of on-chip matching and power combination, commonly using on-chip transformers. Reliability often sets the limits for the PA design, and PA degradation mechanisms are reviewed. A compilation of state-of-the-art published results for linear and switched wattlevel PAs, as well as a few fully integrated CMOS PAs, is presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Microwave heating is rapidly emerging as an effective and efficient tool in various technological and scientific fields. A comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of microwave\textendash matter interactions is the precondition for better utilization of microwave technology. However, microwave heating is usually only known as dielectric heating, and the contribution of the magnetic field component of microwaves is often ignored, which, in fact, contributes greatly to microwave heating of some aqueous electrolyte solutions, magnetic dielectric materials and certain conductive powder materials, etc. This paper focuses on this point and presents a careful review of microwave heating mechanisms in a comprehensive manner. Moreover, in addition to the acknowledged conventional microwave heating mechanisms, the special interaction mechanisms between microwave and metal-based materials are attracting increasing interest for a variety of metallurgical, plasma and discharge applications, and therefore are reviewed particularly regarding the aspects of the reflection, heating and discharge effects. Finally, several distinct strategies to improve microwave energy utilization efficiencies are proposed and discussed with the aim of tackling the energy-efficiency-related issues arising from the application of microwave heating. This work can present a strategic guideline for the developed understanding and utilization of the microwave heating technology.},

Resonant enhancement of transmission loss is observed in the experiment as well as the numerical simulation in Ansys HFSS software when a 2-D standing wave is excited in the narrow air gap. The shape of the choke groove is designed in such a way that ensures standing waves cannot be excited in the frequency band of interest, even considering possible linear and rotational misalignments between the connecting joints during practical operation, thereby making the design very robust. The eigenmode analysis is performed to decompose the mixed excitation mode into the fundamental and higher order modes, and for the case of misalignment, revealing why the electric field changes the direction of rotation above and below the resonant frequency. Experimental measurement results of the fabricated egg-choke flange showed that the transmission loss is less than 0.1 dB in the 2.5-GHz bandwidth from 8.5 to 11 GHz with possible misalignment which validates the design. Other choke shapes are possible following the same design methodology with different scaling parameters depending on the desired frequency band of the user application.},

  abstract = {Reporter-gene assays that employ the Escherichia coli lacZ gene are ubiquitously employed in biological research. However, we were not able to readily identify a quantitative method that worked reliably with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells and that was compatible with high-throughput screening and robotic liquid handling tools. We have therefore adapted a commercially available assay employing a 6-O-{$\beta$}-galactopyranosyl\textendash luciferin substrate to provide the required sensitivity with minimal sample handling times. Our assay uses only one-tenth of the reagents suggested by the reagent manufacturer (Promega) for equivalent assays with mammalian cell cultures and produces rapid, sensitive and reproducible analysis with as little as 1 \textmu l yeast cell culture and with {$<$} 100 cells. We demonstrate that the assay is compatible with yeast strains generated by the systematic yeast deletion project and functions equally well with genomically integrated or plasmid-encoded lacZ reporters and with cells grown in complex or defined media. The high-sensitivity, miniaturized format reduced sample handling required will make this assay useful for a wide range of applications. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The rapid translation of research from bench to bedside, as well as the generation of commercial impact, has never been more important for both academic and industrial researchers. It is therefore unsurprising that more and more microfluidic groups are investigating research using a wide range of thermoplastics which can be readily translated to large-scale manufacturing, if the technology is taken to commercialisation. While structuring, via additive or subtractive manufacturing, is becoming relatively easy through the use of commercial-grade devices, reliable and fast assembly remains a challenge. In this article, we propose an innocuous and cost-effective, under 2-min technique which enables the bonding of multiple poly(methyl methacrylate) layers. This bonding technique relies on the application of small amounts (10~\textmu l/cm2) of ethanol, low temperatures (70~\textdegree C) and relatively low pressures (\textasciitilde 1.6~MPa). Our characterisation analysis shows that using a bonding time of 2~min is enough to produce a strong bond able to withstand pressures always above 6.2~MPa (with mean of 8~MPa, highest reported in the literature), with minimal channel deformation ({$<$}5\%). This technique, which we demonstrate on assembly comprising up to 19 layers, presents an exciting improvement in the field of rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices, enabling extremely fast design cycles in microfluidic research with a material compatible with mass manufacturing, thus allowing a smoother transition from the laboratory to the market. Beyond the research community, this robust prototyping technique has the potential to impact on the deliverability of other scientific endeavours including educational projects and will directly fuel the fluidic maker movement.},

Different studies have been done to find exact correlation of salivary biomarkers with periodontal disease. With a multitude of biomarkers and complexities in their determination, the salivary pH may be tried to be used as a quick chairside test. The aim of this study was to analyze the pH of saliva and determine its relevance to the severity of periodontal disease. Study Design: The study population consisted of 300 patients. They were divided into three groups of 100 patients each: Group A had clinically healthy gingiva, Group B who had generalized chronic gingivitis and Group C who had generalized chronic periodontitis. The randomized unstimulated saliva from each patient was collected and pH was tested. Data was analyzed statistically using analysis of variance technique. Results: The salivary pH was more alkaline for patients with generalized chronic gingivitis as compared with the control group (P = 0.001) whereas patients with generalized chronic periodontitis had more acidic pH as compared with the control group (P = 0.001). Conclusion: These results indicate a significant change in the pH depending on the severity of the periodontal condition. The salivary pH shows significant changes and thus relevance to the severity of periodontal disease. Salivary pH may thus be used as a quick chairside diagnostic biomarker.},

The safety assessment of an antenna is required prior to its radiation interaction with biological tissues. In this work, a specially designed and developed Vivaldi antenna with directivity at 45\textdegree{} for microwave holographic imaging has been presented. A detailed simulation of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and thermal analysis due to the radiation exposure of the designed antenna on self-designed anatomically real breast phantoms is performed in CST environment. SAR values for 3D printed breast phantoms are also calculated experimentally. The quantitative results of SAR reveal the variation of {$\pm$}10\% in between the simulation and experimental results. It has been found that SAR due to the radiation of the designed antenna lies in the permissible limit. The thermal analysis in CST shows the rise of 0.096\% in temperature after the exposure of 2 hours. Hence, the antenna can be used in microwave holography for breast cancer detection.},

  abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major infectious disease threat and include the pathogenic human pathogens of zoonotic origin: severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein, which is structurally categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, within the same group as influenza virus and HIV. However, S proteins have two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by a much wider range of proteases. The exact location of the CoV fusion peptide (FP) has been disputed. However, most evidence suggests that the domain immediately downstream of the S2{${'}$} cleavage site is the FP (amino acids 798\textendash 818 SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFMKQY for SARS-CoV, FP1). In our previous electron spin resonance spectroscopic studies, the membrane-ordering effect of influenza virus, HIV, and Dengue virus FPs has been consistently observed. In this study, we used this effect as a criterion to identify and characterize the bona fide SARS-CoV FP. Our results indicate that both FP1 and the region immediately downstream (amino acids 816\textendash 835 KQYGECLGDINARDLICAQKF, FP2) induce significant membrane ordering. Furthermore, their effects are calcium dependent, which is consistent with in vivo data showing that calcium is required for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed a direct interaction between calcium cations and both FPs. This Ca2+-dependency membrane ordering was not observed with influenza FP, indicating that the CoV FP exhibits a mechanistically different behavior. Membrane-ordering effects are greater and penetrate deeper into membranes when FP1 and FP2 act in a concerted manner, suggesting that they form an extended fusion ``platform.''},

We identified only one study documenting surface disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a {$>$}6.6 log reduction after 5-minute exposure to 0.5\% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small-scale tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1\% and 0.5\% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by {$>$}4.8 log after only 1-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus.},

Three subtypes of AI viruses with different complex refractive indexes (CRIs) were detected at the THz frequency regime. The optical properties of the viruses in the THz frequency range were first measured, and the real and imaginary parts of their CRI are also plotted to investigate the sensing/detecting applications. We observed the resonance frequency shift of the THz MM following the deposition of the viruses on the surface of the proposed design. As an RI sensing application, we show that, with placing different sensing materials in vicinity of the nano sensor/detector device, the reflected resonance frequency changes, which, in turn, leads to measuring the sensitivity of the nano sensor/detector to detect the AI viruses. We investigate the detection of three subtypes of AI viruses with different protein concentrations and different RI values. We observed the resonance-frequency shift of the THz nano bio-sensor/detector following the RI changing of the detected viruses. The resonance shift is higher for the H9N2 virus, which has a relatively large amount of real part of the RI. Thus, the frequency shift decreases with lower amount of the RI real part. Additionally, we show that the magnitude of the reflection spectrum will be enhanced in larger amount of imaginary parts of the RI. This results from a combination of size-related factors, leading to field enhancement accompanying strong field localization.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms of interaction between non-ionic or cationic surfactants with Escherichia coli K-12 cell membranes were studied using an approach based on the registration of changes in the membrane permeability to ethidium bromide, a fluorescent dye for nucleic acids. Triton X-100, a non-ionic detergent, was shown to exert no effect on the permeability of intact cell membranes. Triton X-100 interacted with the bacteria only after treatment with EDTA, a complexing agent for bivalent cations. Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide increased the permeability to ethidium bromide and the action of this cationic detergent did not require the pretreatment with the complexing agent. SDS, an anionic detergent, damaged E. coli K-12 and this could be registered by the lowering of intensity of light scattering by the bacterial suspension. The surface charge of E. coli K-12 cells was shown to influence the interaction of ionic detergents with bacterial cell membranes. Its variation by changing the pH of the incubation medium did not make E. coli K-12 sensitive to Triton X-100.},

  abstract = {Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-known technique used to detect and characterize impedance discontinuities in transmission lines. Usually the application of this technique employs the usage of a step generator to drive one end of the transmission line and a high speed oscilloscope to visualize the signal reflected at various impedance discontinuities points. This paper presents the design and implementation of an USB-based time domain reflectometer which integrates the functions of both equipments and is intended to be a low cost solution for time domain reflectometry. The acquisition technique used is sequential sampling based on integrated delay lines, giving a time step of 250 [ps] at a total acquisition time of about 2.6 [us]. Sequential sampling is successfully used for high speed sampling oscilloscopes and can be implemented using commercially available components. Unlike similar implementations of the method, our proposal uses internal delay calibration to eliminate the ghost effect which limits the minimum measurable cable length. Also, by comparison with random sampling TDRs, our approach allows an improved control over the acquisition parameters.},

The antenna consists of a rectangular microstrip patch peripherally loaded with a single GaAs MESFET. The microstrip patch acts as both the radiating element and the optimal FET drain load impedance required for oscillator synthesis. The active patch element operates as a series feedback oscillator and the microstrip patch is resonated in its fundamental mode. An NEC 71084 packaged FET is used as the active device in the patch element which itself is constructed on RT-Duroid 5880 material. The element has a free running frequency of 9.625 GHz (at 3 V) and exhibits excellent electrical characteristics. Experimental results are presented for the frequency pushing characteristics of the element which are nearly linear. The active element is capable of producing an output power level of 8mW with 10\% efficiency at 2.3 V, and has an external Q factor of 32.},

Picosecond pulses were studied in a physical device by numerical simulation and intensity autocorrelation measurements. The pulse width and pulse-to-pulse spacing were greatly affected by detuning the input laser frequency and the resonance of the optical resonator, and the numerical simulations showed that dispersion causes temporal ripples that are antisymmetric between pulse pairs.},

One aspect of this application is accurately and efficiently modeling antenna and microstrip feeds within the constraints of FDTD approximations. Several relatively straightforward approaches have been suggested, including gap and frill feeds. More complicated approaches, which involve including the coaxial feed cable in the FDTD calculation space, have also been suggested. A related aspect is the desirability of reducing the number of time steps required for FDTD calculations to converge, especially for transient excitation. In this paper we illustrate that for many geometries a simple gap model with an internal source resistance provides accurate results while greatly reducing the number of time steps required for convergence.},

In this paper, a simple design formula that describes the suppression ratio is derived by mode-matching technique. The results of comparison with an FEM simulation validate our proposing formula. It is shown that the technique is indispensable for designing optimal disposition of via-holes to minimize the area of the ground via-holes for desired performance.},

The transmitted field is then reduced to the celebrated precursors of Sommerfeld and Brillouin, far apart from each other. We obtain simple analytical expressions of the first (Sommerfeld) precursor whose shape only depends on the order of the initial discontinuity of the incident field and whose amplitude rapidly decreases with this order (rise-time effects). We show that, in a strictly speaking asymptotic limit, the second (Brillouin) precursor is entirely determined by the frequency-dependence of the medium attenuation and has a Gaussian or Gaussian-derivative shape. We point out that this result applies to the precursor directly observed in a Debye medium at decimetric wavelengths. When attenuation and group-delay dispersion both contribute to its formation, we establish a more general expression of the Brillouin precursor, containing the previous one (dominant-attenuation limit) and that obtained by Brillouin (dominant-dispersion limit) as particular cases. We finally study the propagation of square or Gaussian pulses and we determine the pulse parameters optimizing the Brillouin precursor. Obtained by standard Laplace-Fourier procedures, our results are explicit and contrast by their simplicity from those derived by the uniform saddle point methods, from which it is very difficult to retrieve our asymptotic forms.},

  abstract = {Phage enumeration is a basic prerequisite for application of phages in industrial, medical and other processes. Double layer agar (DLA) plaque assay is the classical method employed for isolation, detection as well as enumeration of phage particles in a solution. However, DLA method is considered cumbersome due to its specific temperature requirements and need for one petriplate with two agar layers for each phage sample. We are proposing a drop cast method for enumeration of phages which is comparatively easier and cost effective than classical DLA method as single layer of agar without any specific temperature condition is required. Added advantage of this method is that 7\textendash 10 dilutions of phage suspension can be enumerated on a single agar plate in contrast to one dilution per plate as required in DLA method. Although standard deviation in phage count was higher in the proposed method than DLA method, still drop cast method provided first-approximation phage titer which can be further validated by DLA method for more accuracy. Hence, the present method can be considered reliable, easy and cost effective for determining approximate phage count in an unknown phage suspension.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global public health crisis. In elderly individuals and those with comorbidities, COVID-19 is associated with high mortality, frequently caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. We examine in situ expression of SARS-CoV-2 in airways and lung obtained at autopsy of individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Seven autopsy cases (male, N\,=\,5; female, N\,=\,2) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a median age of 66 years (range, 50\textendash 77 years) were evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS Nucleocapsid protein in correlation with clinical parameters. The median time from symptom onset to death was 9 days (range, 6\textendash 31 days), from hospitalization 7 days (range, 1\textendash 21 days), from positive RT-PCR 7 days (range, 0\textendash 18 days), and from intensive care unit admission defining onset of respiratory failure 3 days (range, 1\textendash 18 days). Chest imaging identified diffuse airspace disease in all patients corresponding to acute and (N\,=\,5) or organizing (N\,=\,2) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histologic examination. Among five patients with acute-phase DAD ({$\leq$}7 days from onset of respiratory failure), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pulmonary pneumocytes and ciliated airway cells (N\,=\,5), and in upper airway epithelium (N\,=\,2). In two patients with organizing DAD ({$>$}14 days from onset of respiratory failure), no virus was detected in lungs or airways. No endothelial cell infection was observed. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 who developed respiratory failure can be detected during the acute phase of lung injury and is absent in the organizing phase.},

  abstract = {The numerical study of physical problems often require integrating the dynamics of a large number of particles evolving according to a given set of equations. Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing (HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure) represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of the whole set of particles. The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and multi-purpose GPUs. Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user defined heterogeneous data structures.},

  abstract = {The analysis of the stresses in one-, two- and three-dimensional spinning bodies is discussed in a systematic and comprehensive way. First elastic solutions are derived for rods, for elliptical-shaped flat disks and for ellipsoidal solid bodies spinning about their sideways axes. Then the spins for first plastic yield are found in each case using each of the Tresca and the von Mises yield conditions. Then upper and lower bounds on the maximum allowable limit spins where the body would globally fail assuming perfectly plastic behavior are derived. The elastic solutions at first yield always give a lower bound to that limit spin, but global failure generally does not occur until the spin is increased. A way to calculate an improved lower bound is illustrated. Upper bounds are found in a simple and new way. The method uses the fact that the volume-averaged stresses can be calculated directly from the loadings without the need for any actual stress solutions, and then it is proved that the use of those average stresses in the yield functions always gives an upper bound to the limit loads. That use of the statically determinate average stresses to obtain meaningful plastic upper bounds to limit loads is though to be a new method, and can be applied to any shape. Finally, several finite element calculations are used to determine the quantitative relations between the lower and upper bounds and the actual limit spins for ellipsoidal bodies. The results are of interest in the spin of planetary bodies, where they explain the nature of an average-stress approximate method, and in the analysis of spinning bodies in general. In addition, the approach gives a very interesting example of the utility of the limit analysis approaches of plasticity theories.},

Whether this supposition proves correct or incorrect, it provides sufficient justification for a thorough inquiry into the genetic behavior of the viruses. There has long been reason to believe that heritable variations occur in all kinds of virus; the multiplicity of closely related strains found in nature (11) leads immediately to this conclusion. Once this inference has been drawn, observations on the variation phenomenon itself can contribute little fundamentally new information until the purely technical difficulties of handling the materials can be overcome. The minimal requirements are: First, the propagation of clones from single viral particles. Second, evidence that the particles themselves are not mixed aggregates. Third, methods of recognizing and selecting mutants arising in the...},

  abstract = {Four FD-TD extensions for the modeling of pulse propagation in Debye or Lorentz dispersive media are analyzed through studying the stability and phase error properties of the coupled difference equations corresponding to Maxwell's equations and to the equations for the dispersion. For good overall accuracy the author shows that all schemes should be run at their Courant stability limit, and that the timestep should finely resolve the medium timescales. Particularly, for Debye schemes it should be at least /spl Delta/t=10/sup /spl minus/3//spl tau/, while for Lorentz schemes it should be /spl Delta/t=10/sup /spl minus/2//spl tau/, where /spl tau/ is a typical medium relaxation time. A numerical experiment with a Debye medium confirms this. The author has determined that two of the discretizations for Debye media are totally equivalent. In the Lorentz medium case the author establishes that the method that uses the polarization differential equation to model dispersion is stable for all wavenumbers, and that the method using the local-in-time constitutive relation is weakly unstable for modes with wavenumber k such that k/spl Delta/x{$>$}/spl pi//2.{$<>$}},

The method yields the polymer surface rich in carboxylic acid groups and may thus be also useful for further surface modification protocols (e.g. immobilization of enzymes on the surface of the polymer). The method has been designed particularly for use in microfluidics applications. The surfaces obtained via the method are extremely durable and can be stored without any special conditions for at least one year.},

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of different sterilization techniques and to compare the characteristics of the material before and after sterilization of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microchips. For this, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) along with standard sterilization methods such as ultraviolet (UV), heat (autoclaving), ethylene oxide (EtO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were applied. The treated microchips were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Laser Scanning Microscopy in order to ascertain any changes in the chemical structure and surface morphology. The optimum sterilization parameters for SC-CO2 were elicited as 120bar, 40\textdegree C and 60min which provided complete sterility and did not alter the main properties of the polymer along with EtO and H2O2 sterilizations unlike heat and UV treatments. However, surface roughness and microchannel profiles were negatively affected. Although complete sterility was achieved, each protocol has its own strengths and weaknesses.},

The intensity of the 3220-cm-1 band vanishes as the r.h. is decreased from 98\% to around 80\%, which indicates that the hydrogen-bond network of water is disrupted in the primary hydration shell (which therefore cannot have an ``ice-like'' structure). The number of water molecules in the primary hydration shell was determined from the intensity of the {$\sim$} 3200-cm-1 band as about 30 water molecules per nucleotide pair. The {$\sim$} 3400-cm-1 O-H stretch band was used for determining the total water content, and this band persists at 0\% r.h., implying that 5\textendash 6 tightly bound water molecules per nucleotide pair remain. The frequency of the {$\sim$} 3400-cm-1 O-H stretch mode is lower by 30 to 45 cm-1 in the primary hydration shell compared to free water. The water content as a function of r.h. obtained from these experiments agrees with gravimetric measurements.

  abstract = {The Coronaviridae family is characterized by a nucleocapsid that is composed of the genome RNA molecule in combination with the nucleoprotein (N protein) within a virion. The most striking physiochemical feature of the N protein of SARS-CoV is that it is a typical basic protein with a high predicted pI and high hydrophilicity, which is consistent with its function of binding to the ribophosphate backbone of the RNA molecule. The predicted high extent of phosphorylation of the N protein on multiple candidate phosphorylation sites demonstrates that it would be related to important functions, such as RNA-binding and localization to the nucleolus of host cells. Subsequent study shows that there is an SR-rich region in the N protein and this region might be involved in the protein-protein interaction. The abundant antigenic sites predicted in the N protein, as well as experimental evidence with synthesized polypeptides, indicate that the N protein is one of the major antigens of the SARS-CoV. Compared with other viral structural proteins, the low variation rate of the N protein with regards to its size suggests its importance to the survival of the virus.},

  abstract = {Many viruses need to stabilize their capsid structure against DNA pressure and for survival in hostile environments. The 9 kDa outer capsid protein (Soc) of bacteriophage T4, which stabilizes the virus, attaches to the capsid during the final stage of maturation. There are 870 Soc molecules that act as ``glue'' between neighboring hexameric capsomers, forming a ``cage'' that stabilizes the T4 capsid against extremes of pH and temperature. Here we report a 1.9 \AA{} resolution crystal structure of Soc from the bacteriophage RB69, a close relative of T4. The RB69 crystal structure and a homology model of T4 Soc were fitted into the cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the T4 capsid. This established the region of Soc that interacts with the major capsid protein and suggested a mechanism, verified by extensive mutational and biochemical studies, for stabilization of the capsid in which the Soc trimers act as clamps between neighboring capsomers. The results demonstrate the factors involved in stabilizing not only the capsids of T4-like bacteriophages but also many other virus capsids.},

This process is followed by disassembly of the phage into DNA and protein with concomitant loss of viability. Studies with the amber mutant R4 have shown that alterations in the gene-3 product decrease the stability of the phage and that therefore this cistron codes for the A protein. A second capsid protein has been isolated using a new method of phage protein preparation: it might be the A protein. A model for the anatomy of the phage is presented.},

The amplitudes and profiles of the acoustic pulses developing in atherosclerotic human aorta tissues and an aqueous CuCl2 solution under laser irradiation are investigated as a function of the laser pulse energy fluence. The results obtained point to the absence of the cold spallation of the objects of study by rarefaction waves. Based on experimental data, the rise rates, pressure gradients, and propagation velocities of shock waves in the biotissue are calculated.

  abstract = {This article is a study of an empirical design of an open-ended coaxial cavity resonator. The coaxial cavity resonator can be designed using the coaxial transmission-line theory. It can be done by using the radius of the inner conductor, the inner radius, and the length of the resonator. However, the basic coaxial transmission-line theory can be seen that the characteristics of the resonant frequency and the Q value are varied by the change of length, regardless of the value of radius of the inner conductor and inner radius of the resonator. We find out the impact of radius of the inner conductor, inner radius of the resonator, and the length of the resonator parameter and propose the optimized empirical resonator design method by reducing the error between the theoretical value and the design value. High frequency structure simulator was used for simulation and the material of the resonator was designed with a copper. Based on the simulation, several resonators are fabricated by the size of 14 mm for the radius of inner conductor, 2, 5, and 10 mm, respectively, for the inner radius of resonator, and 8.5 mm for the length of the resonator. The resonant frequencies of the produced resonators were measured at 6.1, 5.7, and 6.5 GHz, respectively. According to the result of simulation and measurement, we know that we can design the relatively exact open-ended coaxial cavity resonator by applying the basic coaxial transmission-line theory directly when the length of the resonator is less than 10 mm, and adding the correction factor of 0.5 GHz to the calculated resonant frequency in case of more than 10 mm of the length of the resonator. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Surface hydrolysis was carried out by means of sodium hydroxide solutions, leading to the formation of carboxylate groups. Three commercial polyester films of 100 {$\mu$}m in thickness were used in this work: AryLite\texttrademark, Mylar\texttrademark, and Teonex\texttrademark, hydrolysis time being the main modification parameter. FTIR-ATR analysis, topography and contact angle (CA) measurements, surface free energy (SFE) and T-Peel adhesion tests were carried out to characterize the modified films. A quantitative estimate of the carboxylates surface coverage as a function of treatment time was obtained through a supramolecular approach, i.e. the ionic self-assembly of a tetracationic porphyrin chromophore onto the film surface. The surface free energy and critical surface tension of the hydrolyzed polyesters was evaluated by means of Zisman, Saito, Berthelot and Owens-Wendt methods. It was shown that NaOH solution treatment increases roughness, polarity and surface free energy of polymers. As a result, T-Peel strengths for modified Mylar\texttrademark{} and Teonex\texttrademark{} films were respectively 2.2 and 1.8 times higher than that for the unmodified films, whereas AryLite\texttrademark{} adhesion test failed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests. Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible. In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses. Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus. By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection. In contrast to in vitro examinations, the results of these tests allow use recommendations of chemical disinfectants for outbreak situations and daily routine disinfection.},

  abstract = {Infectious diseases caused by enveloped viruses, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year. Studies have found a relationship among temperature, humidity, and influenza virus incidence, transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity. Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets. Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high ({$>$}85\%) and low ({$<$}60\%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs ({$\sim$}60 to 85\%). At an AH of less than 22 g {$\cdot$} m-3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g {$\cdot$} m-3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude. At a fixed RH of 75\%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19\textdegree C and 25\textdegree C. We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity. The model explained 83\% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets. This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets.IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses are responsible for a number of infectious diseases resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year in the United States. There has been a lively debate in the literature over whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) modulates virus infectivity. We designed a controlled study and used advanced statistical modeling techniques specifically to address this question. By providing an improved understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and virus infectivity, our work will ultimately lead to improved strategies for predicting and controlling disease transmission.},

Assuming the virus particle being of spherical shape, its capsid consisting primarily of glycoproteins, a viscous fluid model is adopted while the outside medium of the sphere is taken to be ideal fluid. The electrical charge distribution of virus particle is assumed to be spherically symmetric with a variation along the radius. The generated acoustic-mechanical oscillations are computed by solving a boundary value problem analytically, making use of the Green\&rsquo;s function approach. Resonance conditions to achieve maximum energy transfer from microwave radiation to acoustic oscillation to the particle is investigated. Estimation of the feasibility of the technique to compete virus epidemics either for sterilization of spaces and/or use for future therapeutic applications is examined briefly.},

It was the intent of this study to determine whether HTST pasteurization conducted in a continuous-flow pasteurizer that simulates commercial operation would enhance FMDV inactivation in milk. Cows were inoculated in the mammary gland with the field strain of FMDV (01/UK). Infected raw whole milk and 2\% milk were then pasteurized using an Arm-field pilot-scale, continuous-flow HTST pasteurizer equipped with a plate-and-frame heat exchanger and a holding tube. The milk samples, containing FMDV at levels of up to 104 plaque-forming units/mL, were pasteurized at temperatures ranging from 72 to 95\textdegree C at holding times of either 18.6 or 36s. Pasteurization decreased virus infectivity by 4 log10 to undetectable levels in tissue culture. However, residual infectivity was still detectable for selected pasteurized milk samples, as shown by intramuscular and intradermal inoculation of milk into na\"ive steers. Although HTST pasteurization did not completely inactivate viral infectivity in whole and 2\% milk, possibly because a fraction of the virus was protected by the milk fat and the casein proteins, it greatly reduced the risk of natural transmission of FMDV by milk.},

  abstract = {Multifunctional nanoparticle-mediated imaging and therapeutic techniques are promising modalities for accurate localization and targeted treatment of cancer in clinical settings. Thermoacoustic (TA) imaging is highly sensitive to detect the distribution of water, ions or specific nanoprobes and provides excellent resolution, good contrast and superior tissue penetrability. TA therapy is a potential non-invasive approach for the treatment of deep-seated tumors. In this study, human serum albumin (HSA)-functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (HSA-SPIO) is used as a multifunctional nanoprobe with clinical application potential for MRI, TA imaging and treatment of tumor. In addition to be a MRI contrast agent for tumor localization, HSA-SPIO can absorb pulsed microwave energy and transform it into shockwave via the thermoelastic effect. Thereby, the reconstructed TA image by detecting TA signal is expected to be a sensitive and accurate representation of the HSA-SPIO accumulation in tumor. More importantly, owing to the selective retention of HSA-SPIO in tumor tissues and strong TA shockwave at the cellular level, HSA-SPIO induced TA effect under microwave-pulse radiation can be used to highly-efficiently kill cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth. Furthermore, ultra-short pulsed microwave with high excitation efficiency and deep penetrability in biological tissues makes TA therapy a highly-efficient anti-tumor modality on the versatile platform. Overall, HSA-SPIO mediated MRI and TA imaging would offer more comprehensive diagnostic information and enable dynamic visualization of nanoagents in the tumorous tissue thereby tumor-targeted therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Choosing the correct surgical staple height is dependent on knowledge of specific tissue thickness and compressibility. The purpose of this study was to measure the thickness of cadaveric human lung tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2012 and February 2013, whole lungs were procured from 12 donors. Inclusion criteria included negative serology, no prior thoracic surgery, and completion of measurements within 72 hours of death. Tissue thickness was measured in the anterior-to-posterior direction using a tissue measuring device (TMD) at 41 lung locations. The tissue measuring device applied a constant pressure (8 g/mm2) via a plunger for 15 seconds before reading the thickness. RESULTS: Cadaveric lung tissue thickness displayed a large variation by location and within each location. Mean thickness in the anterior-to-posterior direction ranged from 1.5 mm (right middle lobe [inferior peripheral] location) to 9.0 mm (right inferior lobe [mid-central] location). In general, the periphery of the lung lobes was thinner than the central locations (e.g., mean peripheral location thickness: 4.1 mm; mean central location thickness: 5.9 mm). The thinnest tissues among the 12 donor cadaveric lung specimens were found in the one donor with a history of severe emphysema/chronic bronchitis. Height (P = 0.012) and weight (P = 0.036) were positively correlated with tissue thickness. Additionally, after adjusting for height, cadaveric lung tissue was 3.0 mm thicker for females than males. CONCLUSIONS: Large variations of lung tissue thickness were demonstrated throughout the lung as well as within each measured location across different cadaveric specimens. Generally, peripheral locations were thinner than the central locations of the lobes. There was a strong positive correlation between thickness and height, and females had slightly thicker lung tissue than males of the same height.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{1em} Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose:\hspace{1em} To determine the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods:\hspace{1em} This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction\textendash confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75\% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). Results:\hspace{1em} Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25\textendash 63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (6standard deviation) of 4 days 6 1 (range, 1\textendash 8 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days 6 4 (range, 11\textendash 26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2 = 0.25, P , .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0\textendash 4 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75\%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 6 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5\textendash 8 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53\%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 6 4; P = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9\textendash 13 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91\%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 6 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (14 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75\%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 6 4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion:\hspace{1em} In patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT scans showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.},

  abstract = {The facultative anaerobic bacterium Escherichia coli is frequently forced to adapt to changing environmental conditions. One important determinant for metabolism is the availability of oxygen allowing a more efficient metabolism. Especially in large scale bioreactors, the distribution of oxygen is inhomogeneous and individual cells encounter frequent changes. This might contribute to observed yield losses during process upscaling. Short-term gene expression data exist of an anaerobic E. coli batch culture shifting to aerobic conditions. The data reveal temporary upregulation of genes that are less efficient in terms of energy conservation than the genes predicted by conventional flux balance analyses. In this study, we provide evidence for a positive correlation between metabolic fluxes and gene expression. We then hypothesize that the more efficient enzymes are limited by their low expression, restricting flux through their reactions. We define a demand that triggers expression of the demanded enzymes that we explicitly include in our model. With these features we propose a method, demand-directed dynamic flux balance analysis, dddFBA, bringing together elements of several previously published methods. The introduction of additional flux constraints proportional to gene expression provoke a temporary demand for less efficient enzymes, which is in agreement with the transient upregulation of these genes observed in the data. In the proposed approach, the applied objective function of growth rate maximization together with the introduced constraints triggers expression of metabolically less efficient genes. This finding is one possible explanation for the yield losses observed in large scale bacterial cultivations where steady oxygen supply cannot be warranted.},

Airborne transmission via droplets and aerosols enables some of these viruses to spread efficiently among humans, causing outbreaks that are difficult to control. Many outbreaks have been investigated retrospectively to study the possible routes of inter-human virus transmission. The results of these studies are often inconclusive and at the same time data from controlled experiments is sparse. Therefore, fundamental knowledge on transmission routes that could be used to improve intervention strategies is still missing. We here present an overview of the available data from experimental and observational studies on the transmission routes of respiratory viruses between humans, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss how the available knowledge is currently implemented in isolation guidelines in health care settings.},

The passband-width tunability is achieved by placing variable coupling reducers between the filter resonators. The coupling reducers, operating as bandwidth control subnetworks, are designed as detuned resonators made up of a line segment ending in a variable capacitor. The proposed filter structure is experimentally validated with the design, construction in suspended stripline technology, and characterization of a low-cost filter prototype for terrestrial digital video broadcasting receivers operating in the UHF band (470\textendash 862 MHz). Other relevant factors, such as the intermodulation distortion produced by the varactors used to control the bandwidth electronically or the power-handling performance of the constructed filter, are also discussed. The reconfigurable filter module described in this paper is very suitable for the design of flexible multifunction receiver subsystems simultaneously supporting signals with a different bandwidth.},

Colony-forming unit (CFU) is another approach, which has been routinely performed to estimate the live bacterial cells on semisolid agar plates. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative yet highly reliable sensing platform on a smartphone using which growth kinetics of different bacteria can be reliably monitored. The performance of the proposed smartphone sensor has been compared with the data obtained from OD600 and CFU analysis. A good correlation of bacterial growth rates enumerated based on the proposed smartphone sensor, bench-top spectrophotometer and CFU analysis have been observed under the experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {Two classes of T4 capsid proteins, called soc and hoc, were highly purified from capsids by a general procedure for fractionating the capsid polypeptides. Their amino acid compositions, antigenicities and states in the infected bacteria were studied. The number of soc protein molecules (Mr=10,000) present in the capsid is approximately equivalent to the number of P23* molecules, another major protein. The number of hoc protein molecules (Mr=40,000) is lower, being about one-eighth of that of P23* molecules. Electron microscopic observations of antibody-bound capsids suggest that these proteins are distributed over the entire surface of the heads. Mutant phages missing either soc or hoc or both proteins were isolated; these mutants are viable and the proteins are non-essential for phage growth. These mutants have normal morphology but are different from the wild type in several physico-chemical properties. The soc-defective phages are inactivated at pH 10{$\cdot$}6, although the wild-type phages are resistant. The mutant phages are heavier in density than the wild type, as shown by CsCl density-gradient equilibrium centrifugations. A gene located between genes 39 and 56 is involved in the production of the soc protein. Subunit arrangements on the head shells of these mutants as well as the wild-type heads are reported in the accompanying paper (Yanagida, 1977). Binding reactions in vitro of a large number of soc or hoc molecules to defective heads have been demonstrated, which might mimic the maturation of the heads in vivo. The nature of these association reactions was investigated quantitatively by using the specific characteristics of the mutants.},

  abstract = {Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors are widely used for determining liquid properties or probing interfacial processes. For some applications the sensitivity of the QCM sensors typically used (5\textendash 20 MHz) is limited compared with other biosensor methods. In this study ultrasensitive QCM sensors with resonant frequencies from 39 to 110 MHz for measurements in the liquid phase are presented. The fundamental sensor effect of a QCM is the decrease of the resonant frequency of an oscillating quartz crystal due to the binding of mass on a coated surface during the measurement. The sensitivity of QCM sensors increases strongly with an increasing resonant frequency and, therefore, with a decreasing thickness of the sensitive area. The new kind of ultrasensitive QCM sensors used in this study is based on chemically milled shear mode quartz crystals which are etched only in the center of the blank, forming a thin quartz membrane with a thick, mechanically stable outer ring. An immunoassay using a virus specific monoclonal antibody and a M13-Phage showed an increase in the signal to noise ratio by a factor of more than 6 for 56 MHz quartz crystals compared with standard 19 MHz quartz crystals, the detection limit was improved by a factor of 200. Probing of acoustic properties of glycerol/water mixtures resulted in an increase in sensitivity, which is in very good agreement with theory. Chemically milled QCM sensors strongly improve the sensitivity in biosensing and probing of acoustic properties and, therefore, offer interesting new application fields for QCM sensors.},

The group delay, which is important to an impulse radio UWB system, is about 0.42 ns over the most central band, and less than 0.95 ns over the whole band.

  abstract = {This paper presents a low-cost, low-complexity FMCW-based ultra-wideband (UWB) chipless time domain reflectometry (TDR) radio frequency identification (RFID) system, which is suitable for implementing higher order modulation schemes. Higher order modulation significantly increases the information content in chipless RFID. The applicability of phase-shift keying (PSK) and pulse-position modulation (PPM) to chipless TDR RFID leads us to introduce an 8-PSK and an 8-PSK-and-2-PPM combination. The overall data capacity is increased to 16 bits compared to low-order modulation schemes, for example, on-off keying, which achieve only 4 bits. The tag, which is based on a meandered transmission line, can be printed cheaply as it consists solely of micro-strip structures. We built an appropriate interrogation unit since the achievable storage density of a chipless RFID tag greatly depends on the reader architecture and performance as well. The reader features a bandwidth of 1.25 GHz at a center frequency of 7.825 GHz, which allows for maximal power to meet most countries' UWB regulations. The reader's interrogation signal is a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) signal generated by a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that is stabilized by a phase-locked loop (PLL). With this setup the interrogation-unit build is inexpensive. As the reader as well as the tag impact the information content, the complete RFID system needs to be investigated. In addition to a detailed description of both system parts, tests demonstrate the performance of the TDR RFID systems.},

In our approach, solution conductivity variations are generated from bacteriophage lyses of infected host cells and the consequent release of conductive endoplasmic material. To sensitively detect the lysis, low conductive growth media have been developed. A microchip has been fabricated to perform the analysis. The microchip is made of two bare gold electrodes and PDMS microchamber of 36nL volume. Escherichia coli and selective phages T4 have been used as case study. Proof-of-principle experiments are here presented and discussed. The method was characterised in a wide range between 104 and 108CFU/mL, where linear relation was found between conductivity variation and cell concentration in a log10 vs. log10 plot. The method is suited to integration with sample preparation based on phage-functionalised magnetic beads. It has a potential detection limit below 1CFU/chamber and a total assay time of less than 1h.},

We tested this stain with formalinpreserved samples of coastal water and also from depth profiles (to 800 m) from sites 19 and 190 km offshore, by filtering a few m1 onto 0.02 pm pore-size filters and staining for 15 min. Comparison of bacterial counts to those made with acridine orange (AO) and virus counts with those made by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed very strong correlations. Bacterial counts with A 0 and SYBR Green 1 were indistinguishable and almost perfectly correlated (r2= 0.99). Virus counts ranged widely, from 0.03 to 15 X 10' virus ml-l. Virus counts by SYBR Green 1were on the average higher than those made by TEM, and a SYBR Green 1 versus TEM plot yielded a regression slope of 1.28. The correlation between the two was very high with an value of 0.98. The precision of the SYBR Green I method was the same as that for TEM, with coefficients of variation of 2.9\%. SYBR Green Istained viruses and bacteria are intensely stained and easy to distinguish from other particles with both older and newer generation epifluorescence microscopes. Detritus is generally not stained, unlike when the alternative dye YoPro I is used, so this approach may be suitable for sediments. SYBR Green I stained samples need no desalting or heating, can be fixed with formalin prior to filtration, the optimal staining time is 15 min (resulting in a total preparation time of less than 25 min), and counts can be easily performed at sea immediately after sampling. This method may facilitate incorporation of viral research into most aquatic microbiology laboratories.},

  abstract = {For tasks like antenna integration on large platforms or electromagnetic compatibility engineering, accurate and efficient simulation of the interaction of electromagnetic radiators with a complex, electrically large environment is required. Using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, the radiating sources are often too complex to be modeled directly within a large scenario. Also, the internal geometry and the materials used inside commercial antennas are often unknown. Therefore, an equivalent expression for the source is required. We present a field source condition similar to the total/scattered field approach, which excites a radiator's (near) field, based on the field representation in terms of spherical waves. While the expansion coefficients for the spherical wave base can be determined most easily from the radiator's far field (given by, e.g., measurements or antenna data sheets), the spherical wave representation can be used to compute the radiator's field everywhere else. The application of this principle to the FDTD method is presented, and as an example, the radiation pattern of a circularly polarized wireless LAN antenna is used to obtain the antenna's near field, which in turn is applied as field source for an FDTD run. The radiation pattern computed numerically by the FDTD method utilizing the new field source compares well with the data-sheet pattern of the antenna.},

The natural frequencies of such resonances will, generally, be in the microwave frequency range. Some of these systems will be coupled to the electromagnetic field by the charge distributions they carry, thus admitting the possibility that microwave exposures may generate physiological effects in man and other species. However, such microwave excitable resonances are expected to be strongly damped by interaction with their aqueous biological environment. Although those dissipation mechanisms have been studied, the limitations on energy transfers that follow from the limited coupling of these resonances to the electromagnetic field have not generally been considered. We show that this coupling must generally be very small and thus the absorbed energy is so strongly limited that such resonances cannot affect biology significantly even if the systems are much less strongly damped than expected from basic dissipation models.},

Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. The morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the S protein of SARSCoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated.

We investigated whether pathogens present in mucus acquire resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants, and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Both the resistance of influenza A virus and Escherichia coli to alcohol-based disinfectants or ultraviolet irradiation and the diffusion rate of ethanol were determined in artificial mucus or sputum samples obtained from 27 individuals with acute upper respiratory infection. Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate {$>$}10\%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient {$>$}0.7, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P\,{$<$}\,0.001 for all). In contrast, complete inactivation was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation independently of mucus viscosity. Thus, mucus viscosity contributes to resistance of pathogens to alcohol-based disinfectants by decreasing the alcohol diffusion rate. These findings can provide a basis for developing new strategies, including improved disinfectants, for overcoming HAI.},

We have developed a system, which enables simplified and automated detection using a camera and a striped pattern marker. The quantification of bacterial growth is possible as the bacterial growth in the culturing vessel blurs the marker image, which is placed on the back of the vessel, and the blurring results in a decrease in the high-frequency spectrum region of the marker image. The experiment results show that the FFT (fast Fourier transform)-based growth detection method is robust to the variations in the type of bacterial carrier and vessels ranging from the culture tubes to the microfluidic devices. Moreover, the automated incubator and image acquisition system are developed to be used as a comprehensive in situ detection system. We expect that this result can be applied in the automation of biological experiments, such as the Antibiotics Susceptibility Test or toxicity measurement. Furthermore, the simple framework of the proposed growth measurement method may be further utilized as an effective and convenient method for building point-of-care devices for developing countries.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic devices are an emerging platform for a variety of experiments involving bacterial cell culture, and has advantages including cost and convenience. One inevitable step during bacterial cell culture is the measurement of cell concentration in the channel. The optical density measurement technique is generally used for bacterial growth estimation, but it is not applicable to microfluidic devices due to the small sample volumes in microfluidics. Alternately, cell counting or colony-forming unit methods may be applied, but these do not work in situ; nor do these methods show measurement results immediately. To this end, we present a new vision-based method to estimate the growth level of the bacteria in microfluidic channels. We use Fast Fourier transform (FFT) to detect the frequency level change of the microscopic image, focusing on the fact that the microscopic image becomes rough as the number of cells in the field of view increases, adding high frequencies to the spectrum of the image. Two types of microfluidic devices are used to culture bacteria in liquid and agar gel medium, and time-lapsed images are captured. The images obtained are analyzed using FFT, resulting in an increase in high-frequency noise proportional to the time passed. Furthermore, we apply the developed method in the microfluidic antibiotics susceptibility test by recognizing the regional concentration change of the bacteria that are cultured in the antibiotics gradient. Finally, a deep learning-based data regression is performed on the data obtained by the proposed vision-based method for robust reporting of data.},

  abstract = {There has been growing concern about the possibility of adverse health effects resulting from exposure to radiofrequency radiations (RFR), such as those emitted by wireless communication devices. Since the introduction of mobile phones many studies have been conducted regarding alleged health effects but there is still some uncertainty and no definitive conclusions have been reached so far. Although thermal effects are well understood they are not of great concern as they are unlikely to result from the typical low-level RFR exposures. Concern rests essentially with the possibility that RFR-exposure may induce non-thermal and/or long-term health effects such as an increased cancer risk. Consequently, possible genetic effects have often been studied but with mixed results. In this paper we review the data on alleged RFR-induced genetic effects from in vitro and in vivo investigations as well as from human cytogenetic biomonitoring surveys. Attention is also paid to combined exposures of RFR with chemical or physical agents. Again, however, no entirely consistent picture emerges. Many of the positive studies may well be due to thermal exposures, but a few studies suggest that biological effects can be seen at low levels of exposure. Overall, however, the evidence for low-level genotoxic effects is very weak.},

We tackle the scalability issue by introducing a new 3-scale deformation algorithm composed of a high quality as-rigid-as possible deformation at coarse scale, a quasi-conformal space deformation at mid-scale and a new deformation-adaptive local linear technique at fine scale. The two first scales are applied interactively on a visualization envelope, while the complete full resolution deformation is computed as a post-process after the interactive session, resulting in a high-resolution voxel grid containing the deformed model. We tested our system on various real world datasets and demonstrate that our approach offers a good balance between performance and quality.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

The problem of appropriate termination in the guide environment has recently been addressed. Main remaining disadvantages are the volume of computation involved and lack of analytical insight. Moreover equivalent circuits are prerequisites to effective CAD and synthesis. With a view to remedying these shortcomings, we discuss the extraction from the FDTD analysis of equivalent circuits. Two significant examples are considered: the inductive post and the 90/spl deg/ H-plane corner, including a modified form of the same. The circuits thus obtained are subsequently employed in the CAD problem of matching over the full waveguide hand the modified corner by means of two inductive screws. Theoretical and experimental results are in excellent agreement yielding a reflection /spl les/-12 dB over the band 36-40 GHz and showing the effectiveness of the approach.{$<>$}},

The Wilkinson design can also be used as a power combiner because it is made up of passive components and hence reciprocal. First published by Ernest J. Wilkinson in 1960, this circuit finds wide use in radio frequency communication systems utilizing multiple channels since the high degree of isolation between the output ports prevents crosstalk between the individual channels. It uses quarter wave transformers, which can be  easily fabricated as quarter wave lines on printed circuit boards. It is also possible to use other forms of transmission line (e.g. coaxial cable) or lumped circuit elements (inductors and capacitors).},

Human epidemiological studies gave evidence of increased risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma. RF radiation was classified as Group 2B, a possible human carcinogen. Further epidemiological, animal and mechanistic studies have strengthened the association. In spite of this, in most countries little or nothing has been done to reduce exposure and educate people on health hazards from RF radiation. On the contrary ambient levels have increased. In 2014 the WHO launched a draft of a Monograph on RF fields and health for public comments. It turned out that five of the six members of the Core Group in charge of the draft are affiliated with International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an industry loyal NGO, and thus have a serious conflict of interest. Just as by ICNIRP, evaluation of non-thermal biological effects from RF radiation are dismissed as scientific evidence of adverse health effects in the Monograph. This has provoked many comments sent to the WHO. However, at a meeting on March 3, 2017 at the WHO Geneva office it was stated that the WHO has no intention to change the Core Group.},

These MEMS varactors and switches have higher quality factors and much lower loss than typical varactor diodes, making them suitable for use in high Q circuits. Equivalent circuit models for the shunt switch and varactor are presented and are used to fabricate tunable resonators around 10 GHz. Application areas are tunable filters and low phase-noise oscillators for communications systems.},

  abstract = {A distributed frequency multiplier with a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG)-tuned output filter for stable, yet infinitely tunable microwave signals is described. The multiplier is a nonlinear transmission line (NLTL) which can be driven with a 10-200 MHz, 1-3 W sinusoidal power source to produce a voltage sawtooth wave with greater than 200 harmonics. These harmonics are selected by a YIG-tuned bandpass filter, resulting in sinusoidal outputs with low spurious content and a frequency stability derived from the source. This circuit offers tunability far exceeding that of step-recovery diode multipliers at the expense of increased size and lower efficiency. An important result of the present experiment is that practical monolithic multipliers for millimeter-wave outputs can be filtered with little or no degradation in their performance.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The d.c. electrical conductivity and optical properties of undoped zinc oxide films prepared by the sol-gel process using a spin-coating technique were investigated. The ZnO films were obtained by 10 cycle spin-coated and dried zinc acetate films followed by annealing in air at 500\textendash 575\textdegree C. The films deposited on the Pyrex glass substrate were polycrystalline and c-axis oriented. A minimum film resistivity gave 28.2 {$\Omega$} cm at an annealing temperature of 525\textdegree C. The temperature dependence of the conductivity indicated electron transport in the conduction band due to thermal excitation of donor electrons for temperatures from 250 to 300 K. The grain boundary scattering effect due to thermionic emission was confirmed. For temperatures below 250 K nearest-neighbor hopping conduction was dominant in the films. The films were transparent in the visible range above 400 nm and had sharp ultraviolet absorption edges at 380 nm. The absorption edge analysis revealed that the optical band gap energy for the films was 3.20\textendash 3.21 eV and the electronic transition was of the direct transition type. From the Urbach tail analysis the width of the localized state Ee=0.07\textendash 0.08 eV.},
