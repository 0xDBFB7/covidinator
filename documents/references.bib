	abstract = {Electron beam halo formation is studied as a potential mechanism for electron beam losses in highpower periodic permanent magnet focusing klystron amplifiers. In particular, a two-dimensional selfconsistent electrostatic model is used to analyze equilibrium beam transport in a periodic magnetic focusing field in the absence of radio-frequency signal, and the behavior of a high-intensity electron beam under a current-oscillation-induced mismatch between the beam and the periodic magnetic focusing field. Detailed simulation results are presented for choices of system parameters corresponding to the 50 MW, 11.4 GHz periodic permanent magnet (PPM) focusing klystron experiment performed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). It is found from the self-consistent simulations that sizable halos appear after the beam envelope undergoes several oscillations, and that the residual magnetic field at the cathode plays an important role in delaying the halo formation process.},

	abstract = {Galileo was an American unmanned spacecraft that studied the planet Jupiter and its moons, as well as several other Solar System bodies. Named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, it consisted of an orbiter and an entry probe. It was delivered into Earth orbit on October 18, 1989 by Space Shuttle Atlantis. Galileo arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth, and became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. It launched the first probe into Jupiter, directly measuring its atmosphere. Despite suffering major antenna problems, Galileo achieved the first asteroid flyby, of 951 Gaspra, and discovered the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, around 243 Ida. In 1994, Galileo observed Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9's collision with Jupiter.Jupiter's atmospheric composition and ammonia clouds were recorded, the clouds possibly created by outflows from the lower depths of the atmosphere. Io's volcanism and plasma interactions with Jupiter's atmosphere were also recorded. The data Galileo collected supported the theory of a liquid ocean under the icy surface of Europa, and there were indications of similar liquid-saltwater layers under the surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede was shown to possess a magnetic field and the spacecraft found new evidence for exospheres around Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo also discovered that Jupiter's faint ring system consists of dust from impacts on the four small inner moons. The extent and structure of Jupiter's magnetosphere was also mapped.On September 21, 2003, after 14 years in space and 8 years in the Jovian system, Galileo's mission was terminated by sending it into Jupiter's atmosphere at a speed of over 48 kilometers per second (30 mi/s), eliminating the possibility of contaminating local moons with terrestrial bacteria.},

The free-stream utility was improved such that a spatially uniform ﬁeld of particles gets inserted now yielding reliable results for the cells located close to these patches. Implementation of the collision models were validated for two test cases (monatomic gas mixtures and diatomic gas) by observing the equilibration of both the kinetic and internal energies. It was found that the present code had good agreement to the independent codes of HAWK and SMILE as well as to results by G. Bird. The validation of the present codes treatment for the gas/surface interactions was evaluated using the benchmark case of Rothe’s nozzle measurements. Results show that the present version of dsmcFoam obtained good agreements for this case compared to the measurements of Rothe for density and temperature. It was also found that the Navier-Stokes solver of OpenFOAM produced reasonable results, even though the local Knudsen number of the ﬂow exceeds the range of applicability for this method, Kn=0.1.},

The probes for the three smallest volumes utilize a novel auxiliary tuning inductor for which the design criteria are given. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and line width of water samples are measured. Based on the measured DC resistance of the microcoils, together with the calculated radio frequency (RF) resistance of the tuning inductor, the SNR is calculated and shown to agree with the measured values. The details of the calculations indicate that the auxiliary inductor does not degrade the NMR probe performance. The diameter of the wire used to construct the microcoils is shown to aﬀect the signal line widths. Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The propellant considered in this propulsion concept is water. Different microchannels geometries were analysed presenting the impact of the divergent angle on the thruster performance. It is shown that the transmission coefficient plays an important role towards the optimization of the heater chip. Results show that when the transmission coefficient increases by changing the geometry the specific impulse decreases, while the thrust and power consumption increase. In addition, a heater chip with a grid containing 37x37 microchannels with modified geometry can achieve a thrust in the range from 0.286 to 2.923 mN, a specific impulse from 54.4 to 93.7 s, and a maximum power consumption of 0.32 W.},

An oxygen ion beam of diameter 3 mm with energy of 5 keV was extracted from an ion source and the ion beam entered the lens system from a distance of 100 mm. Seven design parameters were identified as variable parameters in the presence of space charge current of 0.1 mA. These parameters are the separation between each electrode of the lens, the aperture diameter of the outer electrodes of the lens system, the aperture diameter of the intermediate electrode, the focusing points at different distances for singly charged oxygen ion trajectories, the applied voltage to the intermediate electrode and the influence of space charge on beam quality and also study of the influence of the mass for the different elements has been investigated. Beam quality was significantly improved when the applied voltage to the intermediate electrode was optimized and found at V2 = - 4500 V, separation distance (gap between each electrode) = 20 mm, the aperture diameter of the lens system = 40 mm and finally the best focused point was found at a distance of 550 mm from the end of the lens system.},

Furthermore, Elmer FEM will be suitable for experienced engineer and can be used for determining the risks in a design or a process that use plasma.

	abstract = {The confinement of a tightly bunched electron beam is studied in a periodic permanent magnet (PPM) focusing klystron. By analyzing the Hamiltonian dynamics of a train of collinear periodic point charges interacting with a conducting drift tube, an rf field, and an applied PPM focusing field, a space-charge limit is derived for the radial confinement of lightly bunched electron beams, and is shown to be significantly below the well-known Brillouin density limit for an unbunched beam. Several state-of-the-art PPM klystrons developed at SLAC are found to operate close to this limit, shedding some light on the origin of observed beam losses.},

A ﬂexible experimental setup with a rotating contact is designed to support this study. Based on the magnetohydrodynamic arc model, the elongation and the commutation behaviour of the arc plasma during the contact rotation progress are simulated. Under the given conditions of the external magnetic ﬁeld and the contact rotating velocity, the arc motion is described in detail by the temperature distribution. The stagnation together with the following rapid jump of two arc roots is observed by both calculation and experiment. The rapid rise in the arc voltage is mainly caused by the increasing difference between the two arc roots displacement in the moving direction, and the jump instant of the arc root on the moving contact is according to the moment of the maximal voltage value.},

	abstract = {The development of karst is a complex system driven by the dissolution of a host rock and the subsequent removal of dissolved matter by moving water. It is the process that, at various stages, initiates or triggers associated processes including erosion, collapse and subsidence. The dissolution of sulphate rocks proceeds by different mechanisms and at different rates to those associated with the dissolution of carbonate rocks. For each rock type different factors influence the process. This chapter is an attempt to summarise the present knowledge of the dissolution chemistty and kinetics of gypsum and anhydrite. These are important for the genetic interpretation of karst features in these rocks. The gypsum-anhydrite-gypsum transitions and recrystallization processes are also addressed, because of their importance to karst development. Many studies have been undertaken on the solubility and dissolution of sulphate minerals, in the context of construction engineering and karst processes. Important works include these of Laptev (1939), Kuznetzov (1947), Shternina (1949), Zdanovsky (1956), Sokolov (1962), Zverev (1967), Lui \& Nancollas (1971), Blount \& Dickson (1973), Mel'nikova \& Moshkina (1973), Wigley (1973), Gorbunova (1977), James \& Lupton (1978), Kushnir (1988).

	abstract = {A series of copolymer containing sulfonyl and carboxyl units were synthesized and used in combination with a bisvinyl ether monomer in the form of thin film. It was found that the polymer matrix became completely insoluble in aqueous solution after baked at low temperature around 100 oC and then turned to be highly soluble in aqueous solution, even in neutral water, when exposed to high temperature above 200 oC. Systematic investigations by using DSC, TG and FTS and a homemade apparatus for monitoring film thickness change in dissolving revealed that the insolubilization at low temperature was enabled by thermally induced crosslinking between vinyl group of the bisvinyl ether monomer and carboxyl group of the copolymer and the solubilization at high temperature was the result of acidcatalyzed decrosslinking. The sulfonyl group of the copolymer acted as a thermal acid generator. Preliminary imaging experiments showed that this polymer matrix could be possibly applied in thermal laser imaging.},

Two types of aerospace components were produced, a low-force rocket thruster and a simulated airfoil section. The rocket was tested in a test stand using varying mixtures of H2 and O2, whereas the simulated airfoil was tested by subjecting it to a 0.3 Mach jet-fuel burner flame. Both parts performed successfully, demonstrating the usefulness of the rapid prototyping in efforts to effect materials substitution. In addition, the simulated airfoil was used to explore the possibility of applying thermal/environmental barrier coatings and providing for internal cooling of ceramic parts. It is concluded that this strategy for processing offers the ceramic engineer all the flexibility normally associated with investment casting of superalloys.},

To accomplish this, aluminum alloys were subjected to nitriding conditions at 773 and 823 K for 0–5 h, using alumina and magnesium powders. The resulting aluminum nitride films were several micrometers thick and the films were dark brown or black. The surface structures of the aluminum nitride films were investigated using a scanning electron microscope, which showed fine acicular aluminum nitride nodules with diameters on the order of several micrometers. Emissivities were evaluated at 298 K using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in a wavelength range of 2–14 µm. Total emissivities at temperatures between 323 and 383 K were estimated from emissivity results obtained at 298 K. It was subsequently found that emissivity decreases with increasing wavelength and an emissivity of 0.80 was observed at a wavelength of 2 µm. Total emissivity was 0.49 \% at 298 K and was in excess of 0.50 between 323 and 383 K.},

In the case of silica coating layers constituted with various structural titania particles (solid, hollow, and core-shell spherical), the dependence of transmittance and emissivity of the coating layer on the particle structure and the layer thickness was investigated and optimized. The results indicate that the coating pigmented with core-shell titania particles exhibits a lower infrared transmittance and a lower emissivity value than that with other structural particles and is suitable to radiative heat-insulating applications.},

	abstract = {Normal spectral emittance measurements were made on a two-layer ceramic thermal barrier coating system developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center. This system consists of a metal substrate, a NiCrAlY bond coating, and a yttria-stabilized ceramic coating. The normal spectral emittance was used to calculate the thermal radiation properties of hemispherical total absorptance and emittance of the NASA coating system. The normal spectral emittance of the coating system was obtained at a single bond coating thickness of 0.010 centimeter, at ceramic coating thicknesses of zero to 0 . 0 7 6 centimeter, at wavelengths of 0.4 to 14.6 micrometers and at temperatures of 300 to 1590 K. These data were transformed into hemispherical total emittance values and correlated with respect to ceramic coating thickness and temperature using multiple regression curve fitting techniques. Equations were obtained which can be easily used by a designer to calculate the coating system hemispherical total absorptance a t temperatures of 700 to 2800 K and the coating system hemispherical total emittance at ternperatures of 700 to 1590 K. The data show that the NASA coating system is highly reflective and therefore can significantly reduce radiation heat loads on cooled gas turbine engine components. Calculation of the radiant heat transfer within the nonisothermal, translucent ceramic coating material shows that a designer, with little loss of accuracy, can use the gas-side ceramic coating surface temperature in heat transfer analysis of radiation head loads on the coating system.},

A tapecasting slurry is a complex system where each organic component has a substantial eflect on the rheological behaviour. In this study the eflect of the dispersant and binders in alumina aqueous tapecasting slurries were characterized with electrophoretic mobility and rheological measurements. In aqueous medium, a 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3\_benzenedisulfonic acid, wasfound to be a very eflective dispersant for alumina. The amount of dispersant required to achieve a minimum of viscosity was equal to 0.2 wt\%. Two aqueous emulsions of acrylic polymers were used as binders. These binders strongly aflect the rheology of the suspensions. The best conditions to obtain a homogeneous stable slurry with a high powder loading suitable for tapecasting were determined in terms of order of component addition, rheological behaviour and ageing of the suspensions. Acrylic binders should act through a cohesive mechanism and lead to green tapes with good mechanical strength. Published by Elsevier Science Limited.},

This technique is based upon the acoustic wave which is generated by the respective motion of the electric double-layer ions and of the charged particles submitted to a high frequency alternating electric field (1 MHz). This motion generates a sound wave at the same frequency as the electric field with an amplitude proportional to the electrostatic potential at the shear plane where the zeta potential is defined, to the particle concentration and to the amplitude of the applied electric field. The ultrasonic signal is detected and converted to a voltage (ESA) by a piezoelectric transducer. In the case of our suspensions, the ESA data are directly proportional to the zeta potential, then the curves of variations of the electrokinetic properties in function of pH and/or dispersant amounts will be presented with ESA values as the Y axis.},

The crystallinity seems to have no effect on helium and oxygen barrier properties but ethyl acetate as aroma compound has a plasticizing effect on the PLA film.},

The formation of pores generates additional surface area to induce further reaction. The reaction thus controls the oxidation in the temperature range from 1050 to 1350 ℃. The oxidation rate becomes slow as the oxide layer reaches a critical thickness.},

On arrival at Saint Luke's International Hospital, more than half of the patients presented with low-grade fever. Symptoms spontaneously resolved soon after admission, although the low-grade fever persisted until the following morning. Low-grade fever after inhalation exposure is not explicable by hydrogen chloride inhalation and therefore appeared to be caused by titanium dioxide inhalation, manifesting as metal fume fever. Titanium dioxide is thought to have no remarkable human toxicity and is considered to be safe clinically. To our knowledge, this is the first report of titanium dioxide inhalation as the potential cause of metal fume fever in humans. Correlations between the degree of fever and quantity and concentration of inhaled titanium dioxide remain to be determined.},

In physics, we examine Wolfram's proposal for a deterministic model underlying quantum mechanics, with 'long-range threads' to connect entangled particles. We show that this proposal cannot be made compatible with both special relativity and Bell inequality violation.},

The emphasis is on the basic physical principles and how one deduces predictions from them, at a level suitable for physicsts in other areas such as string theory, cosmology, particle physics, astrophysics and condensed matter physics. No details are given, but references are provided to guide the interested reader to the literature. The present state of knowledge is summarized in a list of 35 key results on topics including the hamiltonian and path integral quantizations, coupling to matter, extensions to supergravity and higher dimensional theories, as well as applications to black holes, cosmology and Plank scale phenomenology. We describe the near term prospects for observational tests of quantum theories of gravity and the expectations that loop quantum gravity may provide predictions for their outcomes. Finally, we provide answers to frequently asked questions and a list of key open problems.},

The influence of anodic film thickness and various operating parameters, viz., electrolyte formulation, operating temperature, applied current density, on the optical properties of the coating has been investigated to optimize the process. The coatings were characterized by atomic absorption spectroscopic analysis, thickness and microhardness evaluation. The space worthiness of the coating has been evaluated by humidity, thermal cycling, thermo-vacuum performance tests and measurement of optical properties. The anodic film developed herein provides solar absorptance value as low as 0.16, and infrared ŽIR. emittance of the order of 0.80. These results indicate that the process developed is suitable for thermal control applications in space environment. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose. In the summer of 1998, Norvir semi-solid capsules supplies were threatened as a result of a new much less soluble crystal form of ritonavir. This report provides characterization of the two polymorphs and the structures and hydrogen bonding network for each form.
Methods. Ritonavir polymorphism was investigated using solid state spectroscopy and microscopy techniques including solid state NMR, Near Infrared Spectroscopy, powder X-ray Diffraction and Single crystal X-ray. A sensitive seed detection test was developed.
Results. Ritonavir polymorphs were thoroughly characterized and the structures determined. An unusual conformation was found for form II that results in a strong hydrogen bonding network A possible mechanism for heterogeneous nucleation of form II was investigated.
Conclusions. Ritonavir was found to exhibit conformational polymorphism with two unique crystal lattices having significantly different solubility properties. Although the polymorph (form II) corresponding to the “cis” conformation is a more stable packing arrangement, nucleation, even in the presence of form II seeds, is energetically unfavored except in highly supersaturated solutions. The coincidence of a highly supersaturated solution and a probable heterogeneous nucleation by a degradation product resulted in the sudden appearance of the more stable form II polymorph.},

It includes an interactive geometry editor, ray tracing support for graphics rendering and geometric analysis, computer network distributed framebuffer support, scripting, image-processing and signal-processing tools. The entire package is distributed in source code and binary form.
Although BRL-CAD can be used for a variety of engineering and graphics applications, the package's primary purpose continues to be the support of ballistic and electromagnetic analyses. In keeping with the Unix philosophy of developing independent tools to perform single, specific tasks and then linking the tools together in a package, BRL-CAD is basically a collection of libraries, tools, and utilities that work together to create, raytrace, and interrogate geometry and manipulate files and data. In contrast to many other 3D modelling applications, BRL-CAD primarily uses CSG rather than boundary representation. This means BRL-CAD can "study physical phenomena such as ballistic penetration and thermal, radiative, neutron, and other types of transport" It does also support boundary representation.The BRL-CAD libraries are designed primarily for the geometric modeler who also wants to tinker with software and design custom tools. Each library is designed for a specific purpose: creating, editing, and ray tracing geometry, and image handling. The application side of BRL-CAD also offers a number of tools and utilities that are primarily concerned with geometric conversion, interrogation, image format conversion, and command-line-oriented image manipulation.},

	abstract = {We introduce the geometric problem of stackabilization: how to geometrically modify a 3D object so that it is more amenable to stacking. Given a 3D object and a stacking direction, we deﬁne a measure of stackability, which is derived from the gap between the lower and upper envelopes of the object in a stacking conﬁguration along the stacking direction. The main challenge in stackabilization lies in the desire to modify the object’s geometry only subtly so that the intended functionality and aesthetic appearance of the original object are not signiﬁcantly affected. We present an automatic algorithm to deform a 3D object to meet a target stackability score using energy minimization. The optimized energy accounts for both the scales of the deformation parameters as well as the preservation of pre-existing geometric and structural properties in the object, e.g., symmetry, as a means of maintaining its functionality. We also present an intelligent editing tool that assists a modeler when modifying a given 3D object to improve its stackability. Finally, we explore a few fun variations of the stackabilization problem.},

	abstract = {The combined radiation/conduction heat transfer in high-temperature multilayer insulations for typical reentry of reusable launch vehicles from low Earth orbit was investigated experimentally and numerically. The high-temperature multilayer insulation investigated consisted of gold-coated reflective foils separated by alumina fibrous insulation spacers. The steady-state heat transfer through four multilayer insulation configurations was investigated experimentally over the temperature range of 300-1300 K and environmental pressure range of 1.33 × 10-5-101.32 kPa. It was shown that including the reflective foils reduced the effective thermal conductivity compared to fibrous insulation sample at 1.5 times the density of the multilayer sample. A finite volume numerical model was developed to solve the governing combined radiation/conduction heat transfer equations. The radiation heat transfer in the fibrous insulation spacers was modeled using the modified two-flux approximation assuming anisotropic scattering and gray medium. The numerical model was validated by comparison with steady-state experimental data. The root mean square deviation between the predicted and measured effective thermal conductivity of the samples was 9.5\%.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet-induced crosslinking of the film of polyvinyl alcohol with different degrees of polymerization was investigated in air at 25°C. in the presence of sodium benzoate as a sensitizer. Crosslinking is always accompanied by photolysis of the sensitizer. In the absence of the sensitizer, no crosslinking occurred. The gel content increased with irradiation time, and tended to a limiting value, depending on the initial sensitizer concentration. The final gel content increased as a function of the initial amount of sodium benzoate. A plot of solubility (S + S1/2) against the reciprocal of the concentration of sensitizer converted gives a straight line in each case. The number of crosslinks is directly related to the number of sensitizer molecules destroyed. The crosslinking occurred predominantly, and main-chain scission was negligible. This result is in marked contrast to the effect of ionizing radiation, since the ionizing radiation causes only degradation under the identical conditions. This ultraviolet method was applied successfully to the crosslinking of water-soluble cellulose derivatives, such as methyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.},

          ,
            A novel and simple method for gelcasting of alumina was developed using a nontoxic and water-soluble copolymer of isobutylene and maleic anhydride (commercially called Isobam). In this method, there is requirement of only a small amount of Isobam (0.3 wt\%) and neither initiators nor dispersants are needed for preparation and gelation of a 50 vol\% solids loaded alumina slurry. The gelation rate increased with increasing solids loading but decreased with increasing Isobam content. A typical gelation time was 38 min for the slurry containing 50 vol\% solids loading and 0.3 wt\% Isobam. The resultant wet gel was strong enough to allow reversible bending and twisting. This simple gelling system is attractive for wet forming of ceramics because only a single additive, which acts as both dispersant and gelling agent at room temperature in air, is used.},

          ,

              Strong and tough poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/alginate hydrogen-bonded-ionic dual-physical double-network (DN) hydrogels have been successfully prepared by a facile route of a freeze–thaw (25–25–25 °C) cycle followed by concentrated (1.0 mol L
              −1
              of) aqueous-Ca
              2+
              immersion of PVA/Na alginate (SA) mixed aqueous solutions. It was found that, at mole ratios of the PVA- to SA repeat units of 20/1 to 80/1, the DN gels likely evolved a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) morphology of rigid alginate networks dispersed in while interlocking with ductile PVA network to accomplish DN synergy that gave their high strength and toughness, where the high alginate rigidity originated probably from its dense cross-link induced syneresis and dispersion along crosslink-defective voids to result in little internal stress concentration. Tentatively mechanistically, as the 20/1–80/1 DN gels were stretched steadily, their mechanical response was gradually differentiated into distinct synergistic states: the sparsely hydrogen-bonded PVA served as a ductile matrix to bear small fractions of the established stresses at its large elongations; whereas the densely ionically (
              i.e.
              Ca
              2+
              ) cross-linked alginate functioned as a rigid skeleton to sustain the remaining larger stresses upon its smaller local strains. Promisingly, this ductile-rigid matrix-skeleton synergistic mechanism of semi-IPN morphology may be universally extended to all A/B DN hydrogels of large A–B rigidity (or cross-link density) contrast, whether the cross-link nature of network(s) A or B is covalent, ionic, hydrogen bonded or van der Waals interacted. The strong and tough DN gels also displayed satisfactory self-recovery of viscoelastic behaviour, in that their Young's modulus and dissipated energy in the uniaxial tensile mode and dynamic storage and loss moduli in the oscillatory shear mode all recovered significantly from non-linear viscoelastic regimes despite different degrees of failure to revert to (quasi)linear viscoelasticity.},

From a thorough swelling study in both hot and cold water (percentage swelling, gel content, swelling ratio, etc-) the optimum curative dose and curing conditions have been evaluated. The molecular weight between the cross-links exhibited a sharp fall up to a maleic acid dose of 20\% (w/w). A comparative evaluation of maleic acid cross-linked and heat-treated PVA ﬁlms has been done. Better heat stability for maleic acid cross-linked PVA was observed from thermogravimetric analysis. A shift in glass transition temperature was observed for both heat-treated and maleic acid treated PVA compared with the virgin one. IR spectroscopic study indicated the presence of an ester linkage and an oleﬁnic double bond in maleic acid treated and heat-treated PVA ﬁlms, respectively. Maleic acid crosslinked PVA is quite stable in different polar and nonpolar solvents. A deﬁnite structural pattern has been observed in maleic acid cross-linked PVA ﬁlms through scanning electron microscopy.},

Suspensions of up to 50 vol\% solids have rheological behavior, which is suitable for pouring and filling molds. Complex-shaped green bodies are then formed by heating the suspension in the mold for a period of time (typically 15–60 min) at moderate temperature (60°–80°C) to gel the suspension. High green densities (58\%–62\% of full density) can be obtained. The dried green bodies have strength in excess of 1 MPa and may be readily machined. No more than 1–3 wt\% PVA per weight of alumina is necessary, ensuring burnout that minimizes generation of flaws. The ceramic components can be fired to {\textgreater}96\% of full density when fired for 2 h at 1400°–1450°C. Cross-linkable PVA may receive more widespread acceptance in ceramic processing than previous gelcasting formulations because PVA is already a common processing additive.},

The DSC results for the gels displayed depressions of the melting and crystallization temperatures, as well as a decrease of the heat of fusion, when compared to those of PVA free of crosslinker. The DMA analysis revealed that: (1) The glass transition temperature of the wet PVA was lower than that of the dry one, indicating that the water had a plasticizing effect. (2) The gels had a lower glass transition temperature than PVA. (3) The glass transition temperature of the wet gels increased with increasing crosslink density. Possible explanations are provided for these observations.

A thin layer of alumina slurry was gelled on the filter paper tube by in situ polymerization of methylolurea and urea monomers present in the slurry by delivering the acid through the walls of the filter paper tube. The thickness of the alumina tube obtained depended on the dipping time. Alumina tubes with thicknesses in the range 0.7–2 mm were obtained for dipping times in the range 1–8 min. The tubes obtained had good surface finishes and profiles. These tubes were sintered at 1150°C and microstructural observation indicated uniform grain size and pore morphology. A porosity of 40\% and an average pore size of 300 nm were obtained.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a technological breakthrough in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields have been reflected in the development of more complex, safe and effective dosage forms to improve the administration, delivery, disposition and stability of drugs, as well as at creating more biocompatible and biodegradable materials. As a result, modified release devices and functional coatings which improve the effectiveness and efficacy of drugs have been generated. This advancement has been achieved by physical or chemical modification of natural or semisynthetic polymers which stabilize and protect drugs against harsh environmental factors. Therefore, the development of novel excipients with a high functionality and robustness has become an important quest. Among these materials, polyvinyl alcohol is one of the most versatile and biocompatible, since by chemical or physical modification its properties are modulated, improving drug stability, drug targeting, and ensures patient compliance. Freezing-thawing cycles, heat treatment and formation of composites are the most significant physical modifications to improve the performance of polyvinyl alcohol. On the other hand, the chemical modifications by cross-linking with aldehydes, carboxylic acids, sodium tetraborate, epichlorohydrin have enhanced the physical and mechanical properties, such as the oil sorption ability, oxygen and waterproof characteristics, mechanical strength, drug diffusion and rate of swelling.},

This is the first review to look across the broad field of ‘cold water immersion’ and to determine the threats and benefits associated with it as both a hazard and a treatment. What advances does it highlight? The level of evidence supporting each of the areas reviewed is assessed. Like other environmental constituents, such as pressure, heat and oxygen, cold water can be either good or bad, threat or treatment, depending on circumstance. Given the current increase in the popularly of open cold water swimming, it is timely to review the various human responses to cold water immersion (CWI) and consider the strength of the claims made for the effects of CWI. As a consequence, in this review we look at the history of CWI and examine CWI as a precursor to drowning, cardiac arrest and hypothermia. We also assess its role in prolonged survival underwater, extending exercise time in the heat and treating hyperthermic casualties. More recent uses, such as in the prevention of inflammation and treatment of inflammation-related conditions, are also considered. It is concluded that the evidence base for the different claims made for CWI are varied, and although in most instances there seems to be a credible rationale for the benefits or otherwise of CWI, in some instances the supporting data remain at the level of anecdotal speculation. Clear directions and requirements for future research are indicated by this review.},

	abstract = {Achieving high performance on stencil computations poses a number of challenges on modern architectures. The optimization strategy varies signiﬁcantly across architectures, types of stencils, and types of applications. The standard approach to adapting stencil computations to different architectures, used by both compilers and application programmers, is through the use of iteration space tiling, whereby the data footprint of the computation and its computation partitioning are adjusted to match the memory hierarchy and available parallelism of different platforms. In this paper, we explore an alternative performance portability strategy for stencils, a data layout library for stencils called bricks, that adapts data footprint and parallelism through ﬁne-grained data blocking. Bricks are designed to exploit the inherent multi-dimensional spatial locality of stencils, facilitating improved code generation that can adapt to CPUs or GPUs, and reducing pressure on the memory system. We demonstrate that bricks are performance-portable across CPU and GPU architectures and afford performance advantages over various tiling strategies, particularly for modern multi-stencil and highorder stencil computations. For a range of stencil computations, we achieve high performance on both the Intel Knights Landing (Xeon Phi) and Skylake (Xeon) CPUs as well as the NVIDIA P100 (Pascal) GPU delivering up to a 5× speedup against tiled code.},

	abstract = {The numerical study of physical problems often require integrating the dynamics of a large number of particles evolving according to a given set of equations. Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing (HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure) represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of the whole set of particles. The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and multi-purpose GPUs. Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user defined heterogeneous data structures.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of hyperthermal copper atom impacts with copper surfaces have been used to investigate the eﬀects of incident atom energy upon atomic reﬂection and resputtering during physical vapor deposition. No reﬂection or resputtering has been observed for incident energies below 10 eV. However, as the incident energy was increased to 20 eV and above, the likelihood of both adatom reﬂection and sputtering of predeposited atoms rapidly increased. The probability of reﬂection increased with the angle of incidence and was greatest for oblique (glancing) angle impacts. The reﬂected adatoms were strongly forward scattered and retained a large fraction of their initial incident energies. The resputtering yield was highest for incident angles around 40° to the surface normal. The resputtered atoms were typically ejected with signiﬁcantly smaller energies than those of the incident atoms, and were preferentially ejected in the forward direction with a maximum probability at an angle of about 45° to the surface normal. These results have been compared with the published experimental data for low energy ion impact. The dependence of the reﬂection probability, the resputtering yield, as well as the angular and energy distributions of both reﬂected and resputtered atoms upon the adatom’s incident energy and angle have been obtained and ﬁtted to simple relations suitable for incorporation in models of vapor deposition. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The next factor investigated was the suitability of Kanthal A-1 as heater material. Although this material is suitable for use to 1325 C in air, at least one reference does not recommend its use in vacuum at temperatures over 1000°C. This warning is founded in the rapid evaporation of a component (chromium?) from the alloy and verified by tests we performed on bare wires in ultra-high vacuum. Sample filaments burned out after two hours or less at a surface temperature of 1200°C. The heater winding, however, is NOT a bare wire operating in ultra-high vacuum.

Despite its industrial relevance the bonding mechanism is mainly only qualitatively understood and is almost solely applied to the bonding of silicon to Pyrex glass. The objective of the present paper is to review the current state of knowledge of the anodic bonding process. Possible material combinations and current scientific and industrial applications of this bonding technique are reviewed. The various aspects of the bonding process, such as the creation of intimate contact, the cation movement in the glass and the interfacial chemical reactions, are discussed in detail and related to the external current measured during bonding to describe the bonding process quantitatively. A better understanding of the process itself should help not only to improve the process control and the quality of devices, but also to broaden the application of this successful bonding technique to more challenging designs, to smaller device sizes and to systems other than silicon–Pyrex glass.},

	abstract = {Gauss-Seidel method is often the smoother of choice within multigrid applications. In the context of unstructured meshes, however, maintaining good parallel eﬃciency is diﬃcult with multiplicative iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel. This leads us to consider alternative smoothers. We discuss the computational advantages of polynomial smoothers within parallel multigrid algorithms for positive deﬁnite symmetric systems. Two particular polynomials are considered: Chebyshev and a multilevel speciﬁc polynomial. The advantages of polynomial smoothing over traditional smoothers such as Gauss-Seidel are illustrated on several applications: Poisson’s equation, thin-body elasticity, and eddy current approximations to Maxwell’s equations. While parallelizing the Gauss-Seidel method typically involves a compromise between a scalable convergence rate and maintaining high ﬂop rates, polynomial smoothers achieve parallel scalable multigrid convergence rates without sacriﬁcing ﬂop rates. We show that, although parallel computers are the main motivation, polynomial smoothers are often surprisingly competitive with Gauss-Seidel smoothers on serial machines.},

The theoretical analysis on the actuation force by the solenoid with the magnetic plunger is implemented based on the Biot-Savart law. The optimal design parameters of the solenoid are determined to actuate a segmented body. We manufacture the miniaturized robot consisting of two segments and a pair of solenoids. Experiments are performed to measure the linear and angular displacements of the two-segmented robot for various frictional conditions.},

The agarose is incorporated to the previously dispersed slurry and the blend is then milled in a ball mill. Agarose dissolves upon heating, but the dispersed slurry maintains stability up to 708C. Rheological behaviour is studied as a function of temperature for the ceramic slurry with and without agarose.

Melting and vacuum requirements of the equipment were determined based on a furnace capacity of 15 kg of aluminium. Clay based refractory and insulating bricks were used for furnace construction. The vacuum system was made from locally available materials and designed for efficiency required for vacuum casting. The equipment was used to melt and cast small sized specimens using the lost wax technique and compared with green sand and ceramic mould cast specimens. Tensile and shrinkage tests were carried out on all specimens. The results of the tensile tests were 123, 98 and 113 MPa for the vacuum cast, green sand cast and ceramic mould cast spec imens, respectively. Furthermore, shrinkage defect which is common to both green sand and ceramic mould casting was eliminated in vacuum casting. The vacuum casting equipment cost an equivalent of about U.S \$1000.00 (One thousand dollars) to construct and can be easily scaled up for large sized castings by increasing furnace capacity and the size of the moulding flask.},

	abstract = {A low cost traveling-wave pulse tube refrigerator was designed, built, and successfully operated. The main goal of the project was to understand the working principles of such a device and attempt to build and operate the system with atmospheric air as the working medium. We used the thermoacoustic modeling software DeltaE effectively to design the air operated system with well defined constraints and performance parameters. The designed pulse tube components were fabricated based upon the DeltaE results and solid modeling layouts. A jig-saw was reconfigured to serve as the compressor to provide oscillating gas flow. The refrigerator was found to cool room temperature air down to about -45°C a difference of about 75°C between hot and cold regions of the pulse tube. This result is quite remarkable considering the facts that an ingenious drive for the compressor was used and that atmospheric air was used as the working medium (instead of high pressure helium). Additional tests were done using a unique regenerator comprised of stainless steel and nylon screens to help reduce the axial conduction within the regenerator. The refrigerator was then able to reach a temperature of about -60°C. This is an improvement over traditional regenerators that only use stainless screens. For the attainment of cryogenic temperatures, high power density in the pulse tube is essential. Our system does however, operate along the same principles and will exhibit similar behavior, thus allowing extrapolation of what effects or improvements might be expected in a high pressure helium system. Future tests are planned with pressurized helium as the working medium.},

	abstract = {Polycrystalline chemical vapour deposition (pCVD) diamond detectors are being considered for an upgrade of Forward Calorimetry in the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC. In order to determine their radiation hardness, four detectors were continuously monitored during irradiation with 500 MeV protons at TRIUMF to a ﬂuence of 2.25 x 1017 protons/cm2. All four detectors worked at the end of the irradiation period. The detector response A as a function of ﬂuence has been ﬁtted to a sum of two exponentials and to a function A = ao/(1 + a1φ ) where ao is the initial response and φ is the ﬂuence with a1 = 9.8 x 10−17 ± 3.2 x 10−18 cm2/proton. At the end of irradiation the response had reduced to ﬁve percent of the original value. The time resolution was found to be ∼ 250 picoseconds.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a two-dimensional cell-centred ﬁnite volume discretization of the Poisson problem on adaptive Cartesian quadtree grids which exhibits second order accuracy in both the solution and its gradients, and requires no grading condition between adjacent cells. At T-junction conﬁgurations, which occur wherever resolution diﬀers between neighbouring cells, use of the standard centred diﬀerence gradient stencil requires that ghost values be constructed by interpolation. To properly recover second order accuracy in the resulting numerical gradients, prior work addressing block-structured grids and graded trees has shown that quadratic, rather than linear, interpolation is required; the gradients otherwise exhibit only ﬁrst order convergence, which limits potential applications such as ﬂuid ﬂow. However, previous schemes fail or lose accuracy in the presence of the more complex T-junction geometries arising in the case of general non-graded quadtrees, which place no restrictions on the resolution of neighbouring cells. We therefore propose novel quadratic interpolant constructions for this case that enable second order convergence by relying on stencils oriented diagonally and applied recursively as needed. The method handles complex tree topologies and large resolution jumps between neighbouring cells, even along the domain boundary, and both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are supported. Numerical experiments conﬁrm the overall second order accuracy of the method in the L∞ norm.},

	abstract = {Stains, as one of most common degradations of paper cultural relics, not only aﬀect paintings’ appearance, but sometimes even cover the text, patterns, and colors contained in the relics. Virtual restorations based on common red–green–blue images (RGB) which remove the degradations and then ﬁll the lacuna regions with the image’s known parts with the inpainting technology could produce a visually plausible result. However, due to the lack of information inside the degradations, they always yield inconsistent structures when stains cover several color materials. To eﬀectively remove the stains and restore the covered original contents of Chinese paintings, a novel method based on Poisson editing is proposed by exploiting the information inside the degradations of selected three feature bands as the auxiliary information to guide the restoration since the selected feature bands captured fewer stains and could expose the covered information. To make the Poisson editing suitable for stain removal, the feature bands were also exploited to search for the optimal patch for the pixels in the stain region, and the searched patch was used to construct the color constraint on the original Poisson editing to ensure the restoration of the original color of paintings. Speciﬁcally, this method mainly consists of two steps: feature band selection from hyperspectral data by establishing rules and reconstruction of stain contaminated regions of RGB image with color constrained Poisson editing. Four Chinese paintings (‘Fishing’, ‘Crane and Banana’, ‘the Hui Nationality Painting’, and ‘Lotus Pond and Wild Goose’) with diﬀerent color materials were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Visual results show that this method can eﬀectively remove or dilute the stains while restoring a painting’s original colors. By comparing values of restored pixels with nonstained pixels (reference of their same color materials), images processed by the proposed method had the lowest average root mean square error (RMSE), normalized absolute error (NAE), and average diﬀerences (AD), which indicates that it is an eﬀective method to restore the stains of Chinese paintings.},

This technology can for example use harvested energy from sources around us such as ambient mechanical vibrations, noise, and human movement, etc. and convert it to electric energy using the piezoelectric effect. For nanoscale devices, the size of traditional batteries is not suitable and will lead to loss of the concept of “nano”. This is due to the large size and the relatively large magnitude of the delivered power from traditional sources. The development of a nanogenerator (NG) to convert energy from the environment into electric energy would facilitate the development of some self-powered systems relying on nano- devices.},

In order to study the effects of crystal structure of the graphite products on their electric properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD) structural parameters, such as, average interlayer spacing (d002), crystallite sizes (Lc and La) and graphitization degree (P1), were measured by the methodology as outlined in JIS R7651. For the temperature dependence of resistivity of these products, it was observed that the minimum resistivity was located at the temperature ranges from 450 to 700 °C. From the relationship between the temperature dependence of resistivity and XRD structural parameters of the graphite products, some control factors of electrical properties at high temperature was discussed. Between the electrical resistivity at ambient temperature and P1, a mutual relationship could be observed. It was seen that the normalized value of the minimum from the ambient resistivity was related with d002. The temperature showing the minimum resistivity was lowered with enlargement of crystallite size along the a-axis, La. The slope of temperature dependence of resistivity at 1000 °C showed a correlation with La.},

Specifically, naive communication schemes can severely reduce the achievable speedup in such communication-intense algorithms. For this reason, we employ overlapping memory transfers to establish a high level of concurrency and to improve scalability. We have implemented our model on a high-performance workstation with multiple hardware accelerators. We discuss the mathematical principles, give implementation details, and present the performance and the scalability of the system.},

	abstract = {High-power accelerators are being studied for several projects including accelerator driven neutron or neutrino sources. The low energy part of these facilities has to be carefully optimized to match the beam requirements of the higher energy parts. In this low energy part, the space charge self force, induced by a high intensity beam, has to be carefully controlled. This nonlinear force can generate a large and irreversible emittance growth of the beam. To reduce the space charge (SC), neutralization of the beam charge can be done by capturing some particles of the ionised residual gas in the vacuum chamber. This space charge compensation (SCC) regime complicates the beam dynamics study. This contribution aims to modelize the beam behavior in such regime and to provide criteria to the linac designer to estimate the neutralization rise time and the neutralization degree.},

	shorttitle = {Collective {Electrodynamics}},
	abstract = {In this book Carver Mead offers a radically new approach to the standard problems of electromagnetic theory. Motivated by the belief that the goal of scientific research should be the simplification and unification of knowledge, he describes a new way of doing electrodynamics―collective electrodynamics―that does not rely on Maxwell's equations, but rather uses the quantum nature of matter as its sole basis. Collective electrodynamics is a way of looking at how electrons interact, based on experiments that tell us about the electrons directly. (As Mead points out, Maxwell had no access to these experiments.) The results Mead derives for standard electromagnetic problems are identical to those found in any text. Collective electrodynamics reveals, however, that quantities that we usually think of as being very different are, in fact, the same―that electromagnetic phenomena are simple and direct manifestations of quantum phenomena. Mead views his approach as a first step toward reformulating quantum concepts in a clear and comprehensible manner. The book is divided into five sections: magnetic interaction of steady currents, propagating waves, electromagnetic energy, radiation in free space, and electromagnetic interaction of atoms. In an engaging preface, Mead tells how his approach to electromagnetic theory was inspired by his interaction with Richard Feynman.},

	doi = {10.1145/1508244.1508275},
	abstract = {This paper presents a surprising result: changing a seemingly innocuous aspect of an experimental setup can cause a systems researcher to draw wrong conclusions from an experiment. What appears to be an innocuous aspect in the experimental setup may in fact introduce a significant bias in an evaluation. This phenomenon is called measurement bias in the natural and social sciences.
 Our results demonstrate that measurement bias is significant and commonplace in computer system evaluation. By significant we mean that measurement bias can lead to a performance analysis that either over-states an effect or even yields an incorrect conclusion. By commonplace we mean that measurement bias occurs in all architectures that we tried (Pentium 4, Core 2, and m5 O3CPU), both compilers that we tried (gcc and Intel's C compiler), and most of the SPEC CPU2006 C programs. Thus, we cannot ignore measurement bias. Nevertheless, in a literature survey of 133 recent papers from ASPLOS, PACT, PLDI, and CGO, we determined that none of the papers with experimental results adequately consider measurement bias.
 Inspired by similar problems and their solutions in other sciences, we describe and demonstrate two methods, one for detecting (causal analysis) and one for avoiding (setup randomization) measurement bias.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new technique for determining a mobile phone’s indoor location even when Wi-Fi infrastructure is unavailable or sparse. Our technique is based on a new ambient sound ﬁngerprint called the Acoustic Background Spectrum (ABS). An ABS serves well as a room ﬁngerprint because it is compact, easily computed, robust to transient sounds, and surprisingly distinctive. As with other ﬁngerprint-based localization techniques, location is determined by measuring the current ﬁngerprint and then choosing the “closest” ﬁngerprint from a database. An experiment involving 33 rooms yielded 69\% correct ﬁngerprint matches meaning that, in the majority of observations, the ﬁngerprint was closer to a previous visit’s ﬁngerprint than to any ﬁngerprints from the other 32 rooms. An implementation of ABS-localization called Batphone is publicly available for Apple iPhones. We used Batphone to show the beneﬁt of using ABS-localization together with a commercial WiFi-based localization method. In this second experiment, adding ABS improved room-level localization accuracy from 30\% (Wi-Fi only) to 69\% (Wi-Fi and ABS). While Wi-Fibased localization has diﬃculty distinguishing nearby rooms, Batphone performs just as well with nearby rooms; it can distinguish pairs of adjacent rooms with 92\% accuracy.},

Recently computational cancer biologists examined gene expression in seven types of solid cancers and traced the ancestry of the active genes they found. Genes that date all the way back to single-celled organisms were revved up. In contrast, genes unique to animals had gone quiet. In cancer, gene-crippling mutations, particularly in genes that interact with both ancient and younger genes, can cause those constraints to break down, so uncontrolled growth occurs. Some of those cancer-driving genes have so many links to other genes that cancer treatments, which usually target just one connection, have limited effects, they proposed.

	abstract = {The rheological behavior of a low-toxicity, aqueous, Al2O3–chitosan–2,5-dimethoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran (DHF) system was examined over a temperature range of 20°–98°C. At room temperature, a high-volume-fraction solids, shear-thinning suspension was produced. The suspension remained in a liquidlike state for ∼24 h. By contrast, at elevated temperatures, DHF became active as a cross-linking agent for chitosan, and a rapid transition from liquidlike to solidlike suspension behavior was apparent. The rate of gelation and the gel strength increased with increased temperature and increased DHF concentration. Gelation occurred at pH 1.4–4.5, which is a complex function of pH. At pH above ∼4, rapid gelation was not possible because of the low-pH solution conditions required for the cross-linking reaction. An examination of the strength and shape-forming properties of several Al2O3–chitosan–DHF systems showed them to be suitable for production of strong, reliable, complex-shaped ceramic components. In particular, small, dense Al2O3 pseudorotors were formed and found to be of sufficient strength for mold removal and subsequent handling. In all formulations examined, chitosan concentrations of {\textless}0.5 wt\% (by weight of ceramic) were required; therefore, the need for a discrete binder burnout process was eliminated.},

We introduce a compact, widely frequency-tunable, extremely bright source of terahertz radiation: a gas-phase molecular laser based on rotational population inversions optically pumped by a quantum cascade laser. By identifying the essential parameters that determine the suitability of a molecule for a terahertz laser, almost any rotational transition of almost any molecular gas can be made to lase. Nitrous oxide is used to illustrate the broad tunability over 37 lines spanning 0.251 to 0.955 terahertz, each with kilohertz linewidths. Our analysis shows that laser lines spanning more than 1 terahertz with powers greater than 1 milliwatt are possible from many molecular gases pumped by quantum cascade lasers.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To review the underlying pathophysiologic processes of concussive brain injury and relate these neurometabolic changes to clinical sports-related issues such as injury to the developing brain, overuse injury, and repeated concussion.

Data Sources:
Over 100 articles from both basic science and clinical medical literature selected for relevance to concussive brain injury, postinjury pathophysiology, and recovery of function.

Data Synthesis:
The primary elements of the pathophysiologic cascade following concussive brain injury include abrupt neuronal depolarization, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, ionic shifts, changes in glucose metabolism, altered cerebral blood flow, and impaired axonal function. These alterations can be correlated with periods of postconcussion vulnerability and with neurobehavioral abnormalities. While the time course of these changes is well understood in experimental animal models, it is only beginning to be characterized following human concussion.

Conclusions/Recommendations:
Following concussion, cerebral pathophysiology can be adversely affected for days in animals and weeks in humans. Significant changes in cerebral glucose metabolism can exist even in head-injured patients with normal Glasgow Coma Scores, underscoring the need for in-depth clinical assessment in an effort to uncover neurocognitive correlates of altered cerebral physiology. Improved guidelines for clinical management of concussion may be formulated as the functional significance and duration of these postinjury neurometabolic derangements are better delineated.},

The method is known by different names in different disciplines.  In particular, it is similar to the velocity Verlet method, which is a variant of Verlet integration. Leapfrog integration is equivalent to updating positions

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle v(t)=\{{\textbackslash}dot \{x\}\}(t)\}
   at interleaved time points, staggered in such a way that they "leapfrog" over each other.
Leapfrog integration is a second-order method, in contrast to Euler integration, which is only first-order, yet requires the same number of function evaluations per step. Unlike Euler integration, it is stable for oscillatory motion, as long as the time-step

	abstract = {The on-orbit repair of the International Space Station Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Tracker cooling loop will require that multiple flow tubes be cut during a spacewalk (extra vehicular activity or EVA).  A module containing new pumps, an accumulator, a CO2 storage tank, and instrumentation will be connected to the cut tubes during the EVA.  When the 4 mm OD x 0.7 mm wall stainless steel tubes are cut with an EVA-adapted tubing cutter, the ends will neck down.  Reaming the tube end to its full inner diameter is not tenable owing to the possibility of creating debris and the undesirable use of a sharp object on EVA.  The pressure drop associated with the connections made to the repair module must be understood to ensure proper operation.  If the pressure drop caused by the cut tube neckdown is severe and is not uniform from cut to cut, it could cause unacceptable flow maldistribution in the Tracker cooling loop.

A water pressure drop test was performed on test sections with internal dimensions identical to the mated repair configuration.  The test was designed to obtain information that would allow the pressure drop from the repair to be predicted.  This document describes the test setup, the test and the results, compares the results to predictions in the literature, provides a recommended pressure drop prediction methodology, and defines an allowable neckdown diameter ratio.},

An improved approach, described in this report, consists of impregnating the fiber with a solution of the appropriate monomers instead of a solution of previously synthesized high-molecular-weight polymers. Polymerization of the monomers occurs in situ on the fiber during the solvent removal and curing stages. The in situ polymerization approach greatly simplifies the fabrication of PPQ - graphite fiber composites. The use of low-viscosity, monomeric-type solutions facilitates fiber wetting, permits a high solid content, and eliminates the need for prior polymer synthesis.},

The electric conductivity of the PVA aqueous solution increases rapidly and the growth slows down along with the increase of citric acid content. The viscosity of 13 wt \% PVA aqueous solutions with citric acid had a small increase and remained stable in one week, which was suitable for electrospinning fibers. Porous, interconnected nonwoven nanofiber membranes were electrospun from a thoroughly mixing of PVA / citric acid aqueous solution. The membranes were then heat treated at 140 oC for 2 h. The postelectrospinning crosslinked nanofiber membranes were insoluble in water, while the non-crosslinked electrospun nanofiber membranes dissolved instantaneously. FT-IR spectrum, X-ray diffraction, and DSC thermograms reveal that crosslinking of PVA nanofiber membranes occurred through esterfication reaction during heat treatment.},

	abstract = {Starch gelatinization is a process of breaking down the intermolecular bonds of starch molecules in the presence of water and heat, allowing the hydrogen bonding sites (the hydroxyl hydrogen and oxygen) to engage more water. This irreversibly dissolves the starch granule in water. Water acts as a plasticizer.
Three main processes happen to the starch granule: granule swelling, crystallite or double helical melting, and amylose leaching.

During heating, water is first absorbed in the amorphous space of starch, which leads to a swelling phenomenon.
Water then enters via amorphous regions the tightly bound areas of double helical structures of amylopectin. At ambient temperatures these crystalline regions do not allow water to enter. Heat causes such regions to become diffuse, the amylose chains begin to dissolve, to separate into an amorphous form and the number and size of crystalline regions decreases. Under the microscope in polarized light starch loses its birefringence and its extinction cross. Penetration of water thus increases the randomness in the starch granule structure, and causes swelling; eventually amylose molecules leach into the surrounding water and the granule structure disintegrates.The gelatinization temperature of starch depends upon plant type and the amount of water present, pH, types and concentration of salt, sugar, fat and protein in the recipe, as well as starch derivatisation technology are used. Some types of unmodified native starches start swelling at 55 °C, other types at 85 °C.  The gelatinization temperature of modified starch depends on, for example, the degree of cross-linking, acid treatment, or acetylation.
Gel temperature can also be modified by genetic manipulation of starch synthase genes. Gelatinization temperature also depends on the amount of damaged starch granules; these will swell faster. Damaged starch can be produced, for example, during the wheat milling process, or when drying the starch cake in a starch plant. There is an inverse correlation between gelatinization temperature and glycemic index. High amylose starches require more energy to break up bonds to gelatinize into starch molecules.
Gelatinization improves the availability of starch for amylase hydrolysis.
So gelatinization of starch is used constantly in cooking to make the starch digestible or to thicken/bind water in roux, sauce, or soup.},

Cross linking is a stabilization process in polymer chemistry which leads to multidimensional extension of polymeric chain resulting in network structure. Cross-link is a bond which links one polymer chain to other. It can be ionic or covalent. Cross linking changes a liquid polymer into ‘solid’ or ‘gel’ by restricting the ability of movement. When polymer chains are linked together by cross-links, they lose some of their ability to move as individual polymer chains. A liquid polymer (where the chains are freely flowing) can be turned into a ‘solid’ or ‘gel’ by cross-linking the chains together. Cross linking increases the molecular mass of a polymer. Cross-linked polymers are important because they are mechanically strong and resistant to heat, wear and attack by solvents. However, the drawback associated with cross-linked polymers is that they are relatively inflexible when it comes to their processing properties because they are insoluble and infusible.},

The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure, mechanical and dielectric properties, and thermal shock resistance of the fused silica ceramics was investigated. The results showed that sintering temperature has a critical effect. Use of an appropriate sintering temperature will promote densiﬁcation and improve the strength, thermal shock resistance, and dielectric properties of fused silica ceramics. However, excessively high sintering temperature will greatly facilitate crystallization of amorphous silica and result in more cristobalite in the sample, which will cause deterioration of these properties. Fused silica ceramics sintered at 1275°C have the maximum ﬂexural strength, as high as 81.32 MPa, but, simultaneously, a high coefﬁcient of linear expansion (2.56 9 10À6/K at 800°C) and dramatically reduced residual ﬂexural strength after thermal shock (600°C). Fused silica ceramics sintered at 1250°C have excellent properties, relatively high and similar ﬂexural strength before (67.43 MPa) and after thermal shock (65.45 MPa), a dielectric constant of 3.34, and the lowest dielectric loss of 1.20 9 10À3 (at 1 MHz).},

Properly done, such a seal is hermetic (vacuum tight, good electrical insulation, special optical properties e.g. UV lamps).  To achieve such a seal, two properties must hold:

The molten glass must be capable of wetting the metal, in order to form a tight bond, and
The thermal expansion of the glass and metal must be closely matched so that the seal remains solid as the assembly cools.Thinking for example about a metal wire in a glass bulb sealing, the metal glass contact can break if the CTEs (coefficient of thermal expansion) are not well aligned. For the case that the CTE of the metal is larger than the CTE of the glass, the sealing shows a high probability to break upon cooling. By lowering the temperature, the metal wire shrinks more than the glass does, leading to a strong tensile force on the glass, which finally lead to breakage. On the other hand, if the CTE of the glass is larger than the CTE of the metal wire, the seal will tighten upon cooling since compression force is applied on the glass.

According to all requirements that need to be fulfilled and the strong necessity to align the CTE of both materials, there only a few companies offering specialty glass for glass-metal sealing. Such as SCHOTT AG and  Morgan Advanced Materials.},

Various issues are associated with this control problem, such as low stability margin due to the sharp resonant peak, nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainty, etc. As such, damping controllers are often utilised to damp the mechanical resonance of the nanopositioners. The Integral Resonant Controller (IRC) is used in this paper as a damping controller to damp the mechanical resonance. A further inherent problem is the hysteresis phenomenon (disturbance), which leads to degrading the positioning performance (accuracy) of the piezo-driven stage. The common approach to treat this disturbance is to invoke tracking controllers in a closed-loop feedback scheme in conjunction with the damping controllers. The traditional approach uses the Integral Controller (I) or Proportional Integral (PI) as a tracking controller, whereas this paper introduces the Proportional and Integral (PI)-like Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) as a tracking controller. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes over conventional schemes is confirmed through comparative simulation studies, and results are presented. The stability boundaries of the proposed control schemes are determined in the same way as with a conventional controller. Robustness against variations in the resonant frequency of the proposed control schemes is verified.},

When I later found time to analyze the 1988 data from the GB6 survey, I discovered that the telescope had already been failing at the beginning of my observing run a month prior to the collapse. In 1986 and 1987 the pointing hysteresis (the mean difference between positions measured by north-going and south-going scans) had been about 10 arcsec; in 1988 the hysteresis had grown to 30–50 arcsec. Even more ominously, during the final week before the collapse the north-south beamwidth increased from 3 arcmin to 4–5 arcmin. Had I been able to keep up with the data while observing, I would have realized that the dish was opening up by a significant fraction of the 6 cm wavelength and stopped the telescope. The 300 foot would not have collapsed, there would have been no disaster to justify emergency funding for the GBT, and the Green Bank site might have been closed. In this case, ignorance really was bliss: Green Bank may have been saved by the slow computers of the day and by inefficient single-dish analysis software.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, I designed and implemented a particle-in-cell (PIC) code on a graphical processing unit (GPU) using NVIDA's Compute Unified Architecture (CUDA). The massively parallel nature of computing on a GPU nessecitated the development of new methods for various steps of the PIC method. I investigated different algorithms and data structures used in the past for GPU PIC codes, as well as developed some of new ones. The results of this research and development were used to implement an efficient multi-GPU version of the 3D3v PIC code SCEPTIC3D. The performance of the SCEPTIC3DGPU code was evaluated and compared to that of the CPU version on two different systems. For test cases with a moderate number of particles per cell, the GPU version of the code was 71x faster than the system with a newer processor, and 160x faster than the older system. These results indicate that SCEPTIC3DCPU can run problems on a modest workstation that previously would have required a large cluster.},

High-gravity centrifugation using a heavy medium with a speciﬁc gravity in between that of silicon carbide and silicon is not effective for the submicron particles. In this paper, a novel recycling process for obtaining silicon from the kerf loss powders is reported. The obtained silicon after directional solidiﬁcation was found to be of solar grade. The average lifetime and resistivity of grown crystal were measured to be 1.02 ms and 0.7 O cm, respectively, which were close to the original sawing silicon and casted pure Si ingots. The energy conversion efﬁciencies of the solar cells fabricated from the recycled and pure silicon were found comparable.},

	abstract = {Amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)-based solar cells have the lowest ecological impact of photovoltaic (PV) materials. In order to continue to improve the environmental performance of PV manufacturing using proposed industrial symbiosis techniques, this paper performs a life cycle analysis (LCA) on both conventional 1 GW-scaled a-Si:H-based single junction and aSi:H/microcrystalline-Si:H tandem cell solar PV manufacturing plants and such plants coupled to silane recycling plants. Both the energy consumed and greenhouse gas emissions are tracked in the LCA, then silane gas is reused in the manufacturing process rather than standard waste combustion. Using a recycling process that results in a silane loss of only 17 percent instead of conventional processing that loses 85 percent silane, results in an energy savings of 81,700 GJ and prevents 4,400 tons of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere per year for the single junction plant. Due to the increased use of silane for the relatively thick microcrystalline-Si:H layers in the tandem junction plants, the savings are even more substantial - 290,000 GJ of energy savings and 15.6 million kg of CO2 eq emission reductions per year. This recycling process reduces the cost of raw silane by 68 percent, or approximately \$22.6 million per year for a 1 GW a-Si:Hbased PV production facility and over \$79 million per year for tandem manufacturing. The results are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the technical feasibility and environmental benefits of silane recycling in an eco-industrial park centered around a-Si:H-based PV manufacturing plants.},

The exercise was organised according to a plan containing sixty written questions; the compiled answers, relaying accounts on not only the damage sustained by the earthquake but also information on the local geography, demography, history, and economy, are valuable historical documents and are stored in the country's National Archive.Because Secretary Carvalho e Melo (today more commonly known by the title of Marquis of Pombal) was the first to attempt an objective description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists. By analysing and cross-referencing the parish priests' accounts, modern scientists are able to reconstruct the event with some degree of scientific precision; without the questionnaire, this would have been impossible.},

Other known backgrounds from neutrons and 206Pb are limited to {\textless}0.13 and {\textless}0.08 events at the 90\% confidence level, respectively. The exposure of this analysis is equivalent to 23.4 kg day for a recoil energy range of 7–100 keV for a WIMP of mass 10 GeV/c2. The probability that the known backgrounds would produce three or more events in the signal region is 5.4\%. A profile likelihood ratio test of the three events that includes the measured recoil energies gives a 0.19\% probability for the known-background-only hypothesis when tested against the alternative WIMP+background hypothesis. The highest likelihood occurs for a WIMP mass of 8.6 GeV/c2 and WIMP-nucleon cross section of 1.9×10−41 cm2.},

A programming model, Unified Memory Access (UMA), has been recently introduced by Nvidia to simplify the complexities of memory management while claiming good overall performance. In this paper, we investigate this programming model and evaluate its performance and programming model simplifications based on our experimental results. We find that beyond on-demand data transfers to the CPU, the GPU is also able to request subsets of data it requires on demand. This feature allows UMA to outperform full data transfer methods for certain parallel applications and small data sizes. We also find, however, that for the majority of applications and memory access patterns, the performance overheads associated with UMA are significant, while the simplifications to the programming model restrict flexibility for adding future optimizations.},

	abstract = {The choice of an efficient document preparation system is an important decision for any academic researcher. To assist the research community, we report a software usability study in which 40 researchers across different disciplines prepared scholarly texts with either Microsoft Word or LaTeX. The probe texts included simple continuous text, text with tables and subheadings, and complex text with several mathematical equations. We show that LaTeX users were slower than Word users, wrote less text in the same amount of time, and produced more typesetting, orthographical, grammatical, and formatting errors. On most measures, expert LaTeX users performed even worse than novice Word users. LaTeX users, however, more often report enjoying using their respective software. We conclude that even experienced LaTeX users may suffer a loss in productivity when LaTeX is used, relative to other document preparation systems. Individuals, institutions, and journals should carefully consider the ramifications of this finding when choosing document preparation strategies, or requiring them of authors.},

	abstract = {Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are on the verge of a breakthrough in general lighting, due to their rapidly improving efficiency. Currently, white LEDs with high color rendering are mainly based on wavelength conversion by one or more phosphor materials. This Review first describes how to quantify the quality of a light source, discussing the color rendering index (CRI) and alternative color quality indices. Then, six main criteria are identified and discussed, which should be fulfilled by a phosphor candidate to be considered for actual application in LEDs. These criteria deal with the shape and position of the emission and the excitation spectra, the thermal quenching behavior, the quantum efficiency, the chemical and thermal stability and finally with the occurrence of saturation effects. Based on these criteria, the most common dopant ions (broad-band emitting Eu2+, Ce3+ and Mn2+, lineemitting rare earth ions,...) and host compounds (garnets, sulfides, (oxy)nitrides,...) are evaluated. Although many phosphor materials have been proposed in literature in recent years, the number of phosphors effectively fulfilling all six requirements is relatively small.},

Pseudo-spectral solvers featuring infinite order stencils can strongly reduce NCR, or even suppress it, and are therefore well suited to correctly model the beam properties. For efficient parallelization of the PIC algorithm, however, localized solvers are inevitable. Arbitrary order pseudo-spectral methods provide this needed locality. Yet, these methods can again be prone to NCR. Here, we show that acceptably low solver orders are sufficient to correctly model the physics of interest, while allowing for parallel computation by domain decomposition.},

These droplets could have provided chemical reaction centers. However, whether these droplets could divide and propagate is unclear. Here we examine the behavior of droplets in systems that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an external supply of energy. In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet growth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets into two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemically active droplets can exhibit cycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells. Dividing active droplets could serve as a model for prebiotic protocells, where chemical reactions in the droplet play the role of a prebiotic metabolism.},

	abstract = {A galactic algorithm is one that runs faster than any other algorithm for problems that are sufficiently large, but where "sufficiently large" is so big that the algorithm is never used in practice.  Galactic algorithms were so named by Richard Lipton and Ken Regan, as they will never be used on any of the merely terrestrial data sets we find here on Earth.
An example of a galactic algorithm is the fastest known way to multiply two numbers, which is based on a 1729-dimensional Fourier transform. This means it will not reach its stated efficiency until  the numbers have at least 2172912 bits (at least 101038 digits), which is vastly larger than the number of atoms in the known universe. So this algorithm is never used in practice.Despite the fact that they will never be used, galactic algorithms may still contribute to computer science:

An algorithm, even if impractical, may show new techniques that may eventually be used to create practical algorithms.
Computer sizes may catch up to the crossover point, so that a previously impractical algorithm becomes practical.
An impractical algorithm can still demonstrate that conjectured bounds can be achieved, or alternatively show that conjectured bounds are wrong.  As Lipton says "This alone could be important and often is a great reason for finding such algorithms. For example, if tomorrow there were a discovery that showed there is a factoring algorithm with a huge but provably polynomial time bound, that would change our beliefs about factoring. The algorithm might never be used, but would certainly shape the future research into factoring."  Similarly, a

We can reverse the lenses of the electron microscope in order to demagnify as well as magnify. A source of ions, sent through the microscope lenses in reverse, could be focused to a very small spot. We could write with that spot like we write in a TV cathode ray oscilloscope, by going across in lines, and having an adjustment which determines the amount of material which is going to be deposited as we scan in lines.
This method might be very slow because of space charge limitations. There will be more rapid methods. We could first make, perhaps by some photo process, a screen which has holes in it in the form of the letters. Then we would strike an arc behind the holes and draw metallic ions through the holes; then we could again use our system of lenses and make a small image in the form of ions, which would deposit the metal on the pin.

Multiple species, internal energy modes (rotation and vibration), chemistry, and ion transport are modelled. A new trace species methodology for collisions and chemistry is used to obtain statistics for small species concentrations. Gas phase chemistry is modelled using steric factors derived from Arrhenius reaction rates or in a manner similar to contiuum modelling. Surface chemistry is modelled with surface reaction probabilities; an optional site density, energy dependent, coverage model is included. Electrons are modelled by either a local charge neutrality assumption or as discrete simulational particles. Ion chemistry is modelled with electron impact chemistry rates and charge exchange reactions. Coulomb collision cross-sections are used instead of Variable Hard Sphere values for ion-ion interactions. The electro-static fields can either be: externally input, a Langmuir-Tonks model or from a Green’s Function (Boundary Element) based Poison Solver. Icarus has been used for subsonic to hypersonic, chemically reacting, and plasma flows.},

	abstract = {The interaction between citric acid and alumina in aqueous solution is characterized. Adsorption isotherms of the dispersant on the alumina surface, electrophoretic mobility of the alumina particles as a function of the citric acid concentration, and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy of the citratealumina surface complex have been used. The adsorption behavior of citric acid is dependent on the pH of the suspension and the concentration of the citric acid. The maximum amount of citric acid adsorbed on the alumina surface, 2.17 μ.mol/m2 at pH 3, decreases to 1.17 μmol/m2 at pH 8. The adsorption of citrate causes a highly negatively charged powder surface and a shift of the isoelectric point (IEP) to lower pH values. The IEP of alumina can be fixed at any pH value between 9 and 3 by proper adjustment of the citric acid concentration. In situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of the citrate-alumina surface complex gives evidence for a direct interaction between the carboxylate groups of the citrate and the surface aluminum(III) atoms. The rheological properties of alumina suspensions are studied as a function of the citric acid concentration. The data obtained from the viscosity and dynamic electrophoretic measurements correlate well and allow the construction of a stability map of alumina suspensions stabilized with citric acid. The influence of citric acid on the viscosity is discussed using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The interaction potential between the particles is determined by the citrate adsorbed on the surface, leading to a negative particle charge, and the citrate anions remaining in the solution, resulting in an increase of the ionic strength. The adsorption of citric acid also creates a steric barrier that inhibits the complete mutual approach of the individual alumina particles.},

	abstract = {A local relaxation,'method for solving linear elliptic PDEs with O ( N ) processors and O ( VN ) computation time is proposed. We first examine the implementation of traditional relaxation algorithms for solving elliptic PDEs on meshconnected processor arrays, which require O ( N ) processors and O ( N ) computation time. The disadvantage of these implementations is that the determination of the acceleration factors requires some global communication at each iteration. The high communication cost increases the computation time per iteration significantly. Therefore, a local relaxation scheme is proposed to achieve the acceleration effect with very little global communication in the loading stage. We use a Fourier analysis approach to analyze the local relaxation method and also show its convergence. The convergence rate of the local relaxation method is studied by computer simulation.},

The use of LTCC for high frequency applications is appealing due to its low losses, design flexibility and packaging and integration capability. The LTCC thick film process is summarized including some unconventional process steps such as feature machining in the unfired state and thin film definition of outer layer conductors. The LTCC thick film process was characterized to optimize process yields by focusing on these factors: 1) Print location, 2) Print thickness, 3) Drying of tapes and panels, 4) Shrinkage upon firing, and 5) Via topography. Statistical methods were used to analyze critical process and product characteristics in the determination towards that optimization goal.},

Adequate strength, ductility, magnetic properties at room temperature as well as at low temperatures are important factors for vacuum systems of accelerators working at cryogenic temperatures, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) under construction at CERN. In addition, baking or activation of Non-Evaporable Getters (NEGs) at high temperatures imposes specific choices of material grades of suitable tensile and creep properties in a large temperature range. Today, stainless steels are the dominant materials of vacuum constructions. Their metallurgy is extensively treated here. The reasons for specific requirements in terms of metallurgical processes are detailed, in view of obtaining adequate purity, inclusion cleanliness, and fineness of the microstructure. In many cases these requirements are crucial to guarantee the final leak tightness of the vacuum components.},

Calcium iodate was added into the alumina suspension that was dispersed in a sodium alginate solution. The slurry was stable at room temperature but it solidified with increasing temperature. A slurry of 50 vol.\% alumina ceramic powder, 1 wt.\% calcium iodate and 1 wt.\% sodium alginate solidified after being heated at 60 jC for 1 h. In addition to this process, a chelator was used to control the gelation behavior. Associated with the effect of the chelator, the consolidation reaction rate was delayed to longer than 30 min. The gelling properties of the sodium alginate solution and the resultant alumina slurry were analyzed. The rheological behavior of the slurry was examined. Appropriate forming processes were determined. Near-net-shaped green bodies were produced. The resultant green body has uniform structure and smooth surface, and the bonding strength is as high as 8.0 MPa.},

	abstract = {Over the years, rotary compressors have gained significant popularity and widespread usage because of their compact nature and good vibration characteristics. Although possessing many advantages over the reciprocating compressors, one of the performance limitations of the rotary machines is their inferior mechanical efficiency due to the existence of large frictional losses, which occurs as a result of the high relative velocities between components in sliding contact. In efforts to effectively improve the mechanical efficiencies of rotary compressors, a new compressing mechanism has been developed which engages a radical concept of operation that is anticipated to produce a substantial reduction of the existing friction. A friction analysis taking into consideration the kinematics and dynamics of the novel machine is being conducted, where simulated results have revealed a superior mechanical efficiency as compared to other existing designs.},

	abstract = {NARloy-Z alloy (Cu-3\%Ag-0.5\%Zr) is a state of the art alloy currently used for fabricating rocket engine combustion chamber liners. Research conducted at NASA-MSFC and Penn State –Applied Research Laboratory has shown that thermal conductivity of NARloy-Z can be increased significantly by adding diamonds to form a composite (NARloy-Z-D). NARloy-Z-D is also lighter than NARloy-Z. These attributes make this advanced composite material an ideal candidate for fabricating combustion chamber liner for an advanced rocket engine. Increased thermal conductivity will directly translate into increased turbopump power and increased chamber pressure for improved thrust and specific impulse. This paper describes the process development for fabricating a subscale high thermal conductivity NARloy-Z-D combustion chamber liner using Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST). The FAST process uses a mixture of NARloy-Z and diamond powders which is sintered under pressure at elevated temperatures. Several challenges were encountered, i.e., segregation of diamonds, machining the super hard NARloy-Z-D composite, net shape fabrication and nondestructive examination. The paper describes how these challenges were addressed. Diamonds coated with copper (CuD) appear to give the best results. A near net shape subscale combustion chamber liner is being fabricated by diffusion bonding cylindrical rings of NARloy-Z-CuD using the FAST process.},

The sizes and shapes of the cavities, made of thin plates, feature four different mazes. To investigate formability and mechanical properties by shot condition, a total of six parameters (melt temperatures of 730 °C and 710 °C; plunger speeds of 3.0 m/s and 2.5 m/s; vacuum pressure of 250 mbar and no vacuum) are varied in experiments, and corresponding simulations are performed. Simulation results obtained through MAGMA software show similar tendencies to those of the experiments. When the melt pouring temperature is set to 730 °C rather than 710 °C, formability and mechanical properties are superior, and when the plunger speed is set to 3.0 m/s rather than to 2.5 m/s, a fine, even structure is obtained with better mechanical properties. The non-vacuumed sample is half unfilled. The tensile strength and elongation of the sample fabricated under a melt temperature of 730 °C, plunger speed of 3.0 m/s, and vacuum pressure of 250 mbar are 265 MPa and 8.5\%, respectively.},

These models have dramatically improved the performance of many learning tasks, including speech and object recognition. However, today's computing hardware is inefficient at implementing neural networks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann computing schemes. Significant effort has been made to develop electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that improve upon both computational speed and energy efficiency. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully-optical neural network that, using unique advantages of optics, promises a computational speed enhancement of at least two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art and three orders of magnitude in power efficiency for conventional learning tasks. We experimentally demonstrate essential parts of our architecture using a programmable nanophotonic processor.},

In this paper DSMC simulation of Poiseuille flow is made to evaluate the dependence of simulation results on cell dimension and number of particles per cell. In the simulation process a self adapting block structured grid system is employed to make sure that the number of particles per cell is constant. The simulation covers both slip flow regime and transition flow regime and each regime covers both high pressure and low pressure. Our simulation results indicate that the number of particles per cell and scaling factor exert little influence on simulation result for both slip flow and transition flow when the number of particles per cell surpasses 5, but the dimension of cell influences the accuracy of result obviously. The error caused by cell dimension decreases as the diminish of cell dimension. It is concluded that in the DSMC method it is necessary to make sure that the cell is less than 1/2 of molecular mean free path.},

Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientiﬁc enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.},

However, its traditional reliance on a ﬁxed-resolution grid is not ideal for simulations that simultaneously exhibit both large and small-scale ﬂuid phenomena. Octreebased ﬂuid simulation approaches have provided the needed adaptivity, but the inherent weakness of a pointer-based tree structure has limited their eﬀectiveness. We present a linear octree structure that provides a signiﬁcant runtime speedup using these octree-based simulation algorithms. As memory prices continue to decline, we leverage additional memory when compared to traditional octree structures to provide this improvement. In addition to reducing the level of indirection in the data, because our linear octree is stored contiguously in memory as a simple C array rather than a recursive set of pointers, we provide a more cache-friendly data layout than a traditional octree. In our testing, our approach yielded run-times that were 1.5 to nearly 5 times faster than the same simulations running on a traditional octree implementation.},

The contact angle progressed through the four wetting phases similar to other ceramics when the results were plotted on a logarithmic time scale. However, at and above 1273 K the equilibrium contact angle was 0° which is much less than those of typical ceramics. Using the value in phase II, the original contact angle between boron nitride and aluminum (contact angle between non-reacted boron nitride and aluminum) was estimated to be 133° at 1373 K. The wetting progressed by producing another non-wetting material, AIN, in this non-wetting system. The detailed mechanism of the solid/liquid/vapor interfacial advance during wetting in such a system was also explained using Cassie's equation.},

The physical mechanisms controlling this relatively long drying process are not well understood. In this study, several controlled experiments were performed to elucidate the key mechanisms. A one-dimensional drying model was formulated based on evaporation and gaseous diffusion through the part. Experimental data were used to obtain correlations for model parameters. This model predicts the instantaneous moisture content of a gelcast sample with an accuracy of better than 10\% when dryer humidity and temperature, and sample thickness are speciﬁed.},

Although these approaches have demonstrated quality results, the computational burden of solution demands an efﬁcient solver. Design of an efﬁcient multigrid solver is difﬁcult for these problems due to unpredictable inhomogeneity in the equation coefﬁcients and internal Dirichlet conditions with arbitrary location and value. We present a geometric multigrid approach to solving these systems designed around weighted prolongation/restriction operators and an appropriate system coarsening. This approach is compared against a modiﬁed incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient solver for a range of image sizes. We note that this approach applies equally well to the anisotropic diffusion problem and offers an alternative method to the classic multigrid approach of Acton [1].},

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder and black plastic colour (BPC) were used to introduce scattering and absorption, respectively, in the phantoms. The optical absorption coefﬁcient (µa) at 1064 nm was determined using an optoacoustic method, while diffuse reﬂectance measurements were used to obtain the optical reduced scattering coefﬁcient (µs). These optical properties were calculated to be µa = (12.818 ± 0.001)ABPC cm−1 and µs = (2.6 ± 0.2)STiO2 + (1.4 ± 0.1) cm−1, where ABPC is the BPC per cent volume concentration, and STiO2 is the TiO2 volume concentration (mg mL−1). The speed of sound in PVCP was measured to be (1.40 ± 0.02) × 103 m s−1 using the pulse echo transmit receive method, with an acoustic attenuation of (0.56 ± 1.01)fM(1H.5z1±0.06) (dB cm−1) in the frequency range of 0.61–1.25 MHz, and a density, calculated by measuring the displacement of water, of 1.00 ± 0.04 g cm−3. The speed of sound and density of PVCP are similar to tissue, and together with the user-adjustable optical properties, make this material well suited for developing tissue-equivalent phantoms for biomedical optoacoustics.},

              rheological techniques are used to characterize and investigate the structure–property relationships for a two-step photoinitiated alginate crosslinking system.

          ,

              We examine the gelation of alginate undergoing ionic crosslinking upon ultraviolet (UV) irradiation using
              in situ
              dynamic rheology. Hydrogels are formed by combining alginate with calcium carbonate (CaCO
              3
              ) particles and a photoacid generator (PAG). The PAG is photolyzed upon UV irradiation, resulting in the release of free calcium ions for ionic crosslinking. The viscous and elastic moduli during gelation are monitored as a function of the UV irradiation intensity, exposure time, alginate concentration, and the ratio between alginate and calcium carbonate. Gel time decreases as irradiation intensity increases because a larger concentration of PAG is photolyzed. Interestingly, dark curing, the continuing growth of microstructure in the absence of UV light, is observed. In some instances, the sample transitions from a solution to a gel during the dark curing phase. Additionally, when exposed to constant UV irradiation after the dark curing phase, samples reach the same plateau modulus as samples exposed to constant UV without dark curing, implying that dark curing does not affect the gelation mechanism. We believe the presence of dark curing is the result of the acidic environment persisting within the sample, allowing CaCO
              3
              to dissociate, thereby releasing free Ca
              2+
              ions capable of binding with the available appropriate ionic blocks of the polymer chains. The growth of microstructure is then detected if the activation barrier has been crossed to release sufficient calcium ions. In this regard, we calculate a value of 30 J that represents the activation energy required to initiate gelation.},

	abstract = {This work explores the synthesis and grafting optimization of PVA-g-GMA hydrogels. The grafting of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was conducted by the trans-esterification reaction via introducing methacryloyl groups into PVA chains and glycidol was formed as by-product. The grafting reaction conditions of PVA-g-GMA e.g. GMA concentrations and reaction temperature were optimized. The kinetic parameters e.g. grafting efficiency (GE) and grafting percentage (GP\%) were calculated to optimize the grafting reaction, while yield (\%) was determined to monitor the hydrogels formation. The instrumental characterizations e.g. 1H-NMR, FTIR, SEM and TGA/DSC, were investigated for verifying the grafting reaction. The UV-photopolymerization was used for photocrosslinking the water-soluble PVA-g-GMA using Irgacure 2959 (I2959) as a photoinitiator. Results revealed that the grafting reaction dramatically increased with increase of both GMA concentration until 0.15M and reaction temperature at 60oC. Also, the surface morphological of PVA-g-GMA freeze-dried gels was found more compacted, smooth and uniform due to the grafting process. A significant thermal stability was noticed, due to grafting reaction of PVA-g-GMA throughout TGA and DSC results. The obtained results are very promising and opening new area for conducting further investigations considering the very low price of the used UV crosslinking method compared to the chemical crosslinking method.},

The electrical conductivity of these materials diﬀered by more than an order of magnitude, 650 (Xm)À1 for CVI and 22 (Xm)À1 for PIP composites at 1000 °C. This diﬀerence is attributed to the diﬀerent carbon content of the materials. Several CVI composite samples were irradiated in HFR Petten to doses of 1, 2 and 5 dpa at 750 °C. The thermal conductivity, after 1 dpa, dropped below 30\% of the unirradiated value, the drop in electrical conductivity was much smaller.},

	abstract = {Based on the particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulation method, the speed-limited PIC (SLPIC) method delivers faster kinetic plasma simulation in cases where the particle distributions evolve slowly compared with the maximum stable PIC timestep. SLPIC thus offers more feasible, fully kinetic simulation in regimes that historically have required fluid approaches, such as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), two-fluid, or Boltzmann electron treatments. In particular, SLPIC allows an explicit time advance with steps much larger than the inverse plasma frequency, avoiding the instability explicit PIC faces with large timesteps. SLPIC avoids this instability by slowing down fast particles (e.g., electrons) in a way that is rigorously underpinned by an approximate Vlasov equation; unlike MHD, two-fluid, and Boltzmann electron approaches, SLPIC does not fundamentally neglect any first-principles plasma physics, although the choices of grid cell size, timestep, and number of macroparticles per cell naturally limit the physical phenomena that can be accurately represented. SLPIC can be implemented with minor modifications of a standard PIC code and does not require an implicit time advance. It enables large timesteps in first-principles kinetic plasma simulation of appropriately slow phenomena, and it can handle many of the same complications as PIC, such as boundary conditions and collisions. In an argon plasma sheath test problem, a SLPIC simulation achieved a speed-up of a factor of 160 over the corresponding PIC simulation, without loss of accuracy.},

Our method is designed for parallel execution on shared-memory platforms and poses modest requirements in terms of bandwidth and memory footprint. Our solver will accommodate as many as 7682×1152 voxels with a memory footprint less than 16GB, while a full smoke simulation at this resolution ﬁts in 32GB of RAM. Our preconditioned conjugate gradient solver typically reduces the residual by one order of magnitude every 2 iterations, while each PCG iteration requires approximately 6.1sec on a 16-core SMP at 7683 resolution.

	abstract = {The role of additives has long been a theme in sintering science. Recently, it has been discovered that ceramics may contain multiple different grain boundary phases (complexions) that are chemically induced by certain additives. These complexions are useful in explaining a number of anomalous phenomena associated with sintering, such as abnormal grain growth. The current work investigates how transitions between these complexions occur and at which grain boundaries they are most likely to occur. The number of complexion transitions that occur increases linearly with grain size (grain boundary excess concentration), and exponentially with temperature. The results suggest that grain boundary energy and anisotropy are important in predicting which and how many grain boundaries will undergo such a transition.},

These mistakes can be caused by extremely small, isolated patterns in code, which can lead to significant runtime errors. These patterns are used in large, popular software projects and even recommended in style guides. To identify code patterns that may confuse programmers we extracted a preliminary set of ‘atoms of confusion’ from known confusing code. We show empirically in an experiment with 73 participants that these code patterns can lead to a significantly increased rate of misunderstanding versus equivalent code without the patterns. We then go on to take larger confusing programs and measure (in an experiment with 43 participants) the impact, in terms of programmer confusion, of removing these confusing patterns. All of our instruments, analysis code, and data are publicly available online for replication, experimentation, and feedback.},

The problem requires evaluation of the school’s football ield turf heating system, incorporates all of the major heat transfer modes (convection, conduction, and radiation), and requires students to investigate both steady state and transient versions of the problem, with comparison to analytical solutions when available. The problem is solved using the inite-difference method (FDM) and an Excel™ spreadsheet with Visual Basic for Applications™ (VBA) programming to facilitate program execution beyond normal spreadsheet capabilities. The project also requires students to conduct a design analysis for environmental and/or system changes, subject to approval by the instructor; suggested topics for this design project are offered. The project is designed so that it is easy for students to understand, and recommendations are offered regarding project design and submission which facilitate grading of student work. While the speciic application described herein is to the school’s football ield, the same approach may be employed in many steady state and transient heat transfer problems—in fact, students have employed the modeling and programming techniques learned in this project to other courses, including their Senior Capstone projects. Results of a student opinion survey, anecdotal data, and performance on the heat transfer portion of the Fundamentals of Engineering examination data are presented.},

Not only can compliance with a set of rules having little impact on the number of faults be considered wasted effort, but it can actually result in an increase in faults, as any modiﬁcation has a non-zero probability of introducing a fault or triggering a previously concealed one. Therefore, it is important to build a body of empirical knowledge, helping us understand which rules are worthwhile enforcing, and which ones should be ignored in the context of fault reduction. In this paper, we describe two approaches to quantify the relation between rule violations and actual faults, and present empirical data on this relation for the MISRA C 2004 standard on an industrial case study.},

The cavities varied in diameter from approximately 1 to 3 mm. Single-sided NDE methods were used since they might be practical for on-wing inspection, while x-ray micro-computed tomography (CT) was used to measure cavity sizes in order to validate oxidation models under development for carbon-carbon materials. An RCC sample having a naturallycracked coating and subsequent oxidation damage was also studied with x-ray micro-CT. This effort is a follow-on study to one that characterized NDE methods for assessing oxidation damage in an RCC sample with drilled holes in the coating. The results of that study are briefly reviewed in this article as well. Additionally, a short discussion on the future role of simulation to aid in these studies is provided.},

These amphiphilic macromonomers, due to the proper ratio of the hydrophilic to hydrophobic fragments, play the role of not only an internal plasticizer, but they also modify the adhesion of such binders to the ceramic powder particles. The influence of chemical structure of these copolymers on the properties of alumina ceramics is discussed.

	abstract = {Automatic inspection of industrial parts with X-rays has been an active field of research for the last years. Because of the nature of the underlying image generation process which creates complex image processing problems, few actual applications have surfaced so far. This paper describes the experience gained with several approaches to automatic flaw detection in X-ray images of cast aluminum wheels. Basic problems are mentioned and the applicability of segmentation methods to actual inspection tasks is demonstrated. The discussion focuses on the definition, extraction, and combination of local features for pixel classification. Results of recent pilot tests are mentioned briefly. Further investigations are suggested, aiming at more generality of the methods and higher stability of the segmentation.},

TRACE 3-D is an envelope (matrix) code including space charge often used to model bunched beams in magnetic transport systems and radiofrequency (RF) accelerators when the effects of beam current may be important. Several new matrix models have been developed that allow the code to be used for modeling beam lines and accelerators with electrostatic components. The new models include: (1) three einzel lenses, (2) two accelerator columns, (3) three electrostatic deflectors (prisms), and (4) an electrostatic quadrupole. A prescription for setting up the initial beam appropriate to modeling 2-D (continuous) beams has also been developed. The new models for (1) are described in this paper, selected comparisons with other calculations are presented, and a beamline application is summarized.},

	abstract = {Shape setting Nitinol tubes and wires in a typical laboratory setting for use in superelastic robots is challenging. Obtaining samples that remain superelastic and exhibit desired precurvatures currently requires many iterations, which is time consuming and consumes a substantial amount of Nitinol. To provide a more accurate and reliable method of shape setting, in this paper we propose an electrical technique that uses Joule heating to attain the necessary shape setting temperatures. The resulting high power heating prevents unintended aging of the material and yields consistent and accurate results for the rapid creation of prototypes. We present a complete algorithm and system together with an experimental analysis of temperature regulation. We experimentally validate the approach on Nitinol tubes that are shape set into planar curves. We also demonstrate the feasibility of creating general space curves by shape setting a helical tube. The system demonstrates a mean absolute temperature error of 10°C.},

Proﬁles of the electric potential, electric ﬁeld and space charge density are found to vary systematically with the pressure p and magnetic ﬁeld strength B , in a way which corresponds to a transition from the usual positive space charge mode at low values of B /p to a higher impedance negative space charge mode at higher values of B /p. This is consistent with a continuous and considerable reduction in the ratio of the electron-to-ion classical cross-ﬁeld transport coefﬁcients with increasing B /p. Results of a ﬂuid model also predict the transition to the negative space charge mode.},

Therefore, fundamental knowledge on transmission routes that could be used to improve intervention strategies is still missing.

Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests. Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible. In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses. Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus. By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection.

Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces.
Methods: The efﬁcacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/ p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70\% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62\% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71\% ethanol).
Results: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log10 reduction factor of 3.2 for 70\% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62\% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71\% ethanol. For MHV, log10 reduction factors were 3.9 for 70\% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62\% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71\% ethanol.
Conclusion: Only ethanol reduced infectivity of the 2 coronaviruses by .3-log10 after 1 minute. Germicides must be chosen carefully to ensure they are effective against viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.},

A comparative study of the physical and chemical properties in bricks obtained using two cold pressing techniques (uniaxial and isostatic pressing) and two sintering temperatures (1550 and 1650 \&deg;C) was carried out. The microstructure and crystalline phase characteristics obtained after the heat treatments and the slag corrosion test was studied using scanning electron microscopy/electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Part of the energy decrease goes into driving the grain growth process, leading to a reduction in the driving force for densification.

Existing disinfection methods such as irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma-ray, UV/photochemicals, microwave absorption, and pharmaceutical antiviral and antibacterial treatments are not selective; as a result, severe side effects may accompany the treatments. On the other hand, the USP laser method has been shown [3, 6, 9] to inactivate undesired microorganisms like viruses and bacteria while leaving desired materials such as mammalian cells and proteins unharmed; i.e., the USP laser technique is capable of selective disinfection and therefore has minimal potential side effects. Table 2 shows experimental results on the selectivity of a near-infrared USP laser on a variety of microorganisms. The intriguing feature worthwhile mentioning is that there exists a therapeutic window in laser power density between 1 GW/cm2 and 10 GW/cm2 which allows the inactivation of a variety of pathogens while leaving mammalian cells unharmed. The existence of this window enables selective inactivation of microorganisms.

It was the intent of this study to determine whether HTST pasteurization conducted in a continuous-flow pasteurizer that simulates commercial operation would enhance FMDV inactivation in milk. Cows were inoculated in the mammary gland with the field strain of FMDV (01/UK). Infected raw whole milk and 2\% milk were then pasteurized using an Arm-field pilot-scale, continuous-flow HTST pasteurizer equipped with a plate-and-frame heat exchanger and a holding tube. The milk samples, containing FMDV at levels of up to 104 plaque-forming units/mL, were pasteurized at temperatures ranging from 72 to 95°C at holding times of either 18.6 or 36s. Pasteurization decreased virus infectivity by 4 log10 to undetectable levels in tissue culture. However, residual infectivity was still detectable for selected pasteurized milk samples, as shown by intramuscular and intradermal inoculation of milk into naïve steers. Although HTST pasteurization did not completely inactivate viral infectivity in whole and 2\% milk, possibly because a fraction of the virus was protected by the milk fat and the casein proteins, it greatly reduced the risk of natural transmission of FMDV by milk.},

Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression. Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses. Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome. This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion assembly.},

	abstract = {Inactivation of collected viral aerosols is important for preventing a filter medium’s serving as a fomite. The focus of this study was to evaluate the inactivation efficiency (IE) achieved through filtration coupled with microwave irradiation. MS2 aerosolized through a Collison nebulizer was fed into the system and collected onto the filter. For in-flight microwave decontamination, microwave irradiation was applied to an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) filter supported on a SiC disk for three cycles of selected irradiation times per 10 min (i.e., 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min/10 min) at power levels ranging from 125 W to 375 W. The survival fraction (SF) on the substrate and the IE through the entire system were investigated to determine the efficacy of this approach. SF decreased and IE increased as microwave power level was increased (p = 0.02 and p {\textless} 0.01, respectively) or the application time was extended (p = 0.03 and p {\textless} 0.01, respectively). Both measures changed sharply above a threshold temperature of around 90°C and reached 2 logs at 116 and 109°C, respectively. The log SF and IE of –2.59 and 3.62, respectively, were observed when the operating condition of 375 W for 10 min/cycle was used and the SiC disk facilitated microwave absorption. When a quartz frit was used as a support instead of the SiC disk, log inactivation efficiencies of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3 were measured at relative humidities of 30\%, 60\% and 90\%, respectively, under the same irradiation conditions. Relative humidity is a significant parameter from 50–80°C (p = 0.01). The results demonstrate that microwave-assisted filtration systems can be used as an effective means for inactivating viruses.},

However this effect was not considered in previous virus-microwave interaction studies and microwave-based virus epidemic prevention. Here we show that this structure-resonant energy transfer effect from microwaves to virus can be efficient enough so that airborne virus was inactivated with reasonable microwave power density safe for the open public. We demonstrate this effect by measuring the residual viral infectivity of influenza A virus after illuminating microwaves with different frequencies and powers. We also established a theoretical model to estimate the microwaves power threshold for virus inactivation and good agreement with experiments was obtained. Such structure-resonant energy transfer induced inactivation is mainly through physically fracturing the virus structure, which was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results provide a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne virus.},

They use a value of "82 W/m 2(lower than the IEEE safety standard in public space)", but the value in canada and the US at is 10W/ m{\textasciicircum}2 at these frequencies. Not a huge deal.
 
2019 IEEE standard is 40 W/m{\textasciicircum}2 (4 W/m{\textasciicircum}2) in unrestricted spaces.
 
If averaging is taken into account we're probably fine wanting 200 W/m{\textasciicircum}2 rather than Canada's 10.
 
If we want to treat 27 m{\textasciicircum}3 at 4 cm{\textasciicircum}3 each, that's 7 million positions. That's like 0.1 us. per position if we want to scan every second. Will 1,000 cycles be enough to resonate the virus apart? Probably...
 
For a wall-mounted device, there'll be line-of-sight dead-spots if, for instance, two people are talking parallel to the beam. Ceiling mount might work.
Are there more places, or people? I think there are more places, so we should put the thing on the person - maybe with high-traffic areas covered seperately.
In that case,
These guys did a pretty great job at the theory, I don't think there's going to be a large improvement in energy transfer with the simulation. Since the limits are generally the same all the way to 40GHz+, there isn't much use finding higher modes.
 
Should make a table with all the different limits.
Are there other pulse shapes that might work better? How about a repetitive pulse, or a chirp?
CHARMM's resonance approximation breaks at large amplitudes, so it's probably not going to be super helpful.
What about a simple ball-and-spring physics sim?
At 1mw/m{\textasciicircum}2, for 40 mW, the antenna only has to be 6 cm to a side. That's tiny!
 
 
Forgot to mention: because the T4 membrane is at least 2x stronger than H3N1, we're good.

	abstract = {Human noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks have suggested that vomiting facilitates transmission of human NoV, but there have been no laboratory-based studies characterizing the degree of NoV release during a vomiting event. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that virus aerosolization occurs in a simulated vomiting event, and to estimate the amount of virus that is released in those aerosols. A simulated vomiting device was constructed at one-quarter scale of the human body following similitude principles. Simulated vomitus matrices at low (6.24 mPa*s) and high (177.5 mPa*s) viscosities were inoculated with low (108 PFU/mL) and high (1010 PFU/mL) concentrations of bacteriophage MS2 and placed in the artificial “stomach” of the device, which was then subjected to scaled physiologically relevant pressures associated with vomiting. Bio aerosols were captured using an SKC Biosampler. In low viscosity artificial vomitus, there were notable differences between recovered aerosolized MS2 as a function of pressure (i.e., greater aerosolization with increased pressure), although this was not always statistically significant. This relationship disappeared when using high viscosity simulated vomitus. The amount of MS2 aerosolized as a percent of total virus “vomited” ranged from 7.2 x 10-5 to 2.67 x 10-2 (which corresponded to a range of 36 to 13,350 PFU total). To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and measure aerosolization of a NoV surrogate in a similitude-based physical model. This has implications for better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection control measures.},

While phages are commonly isolated first and subsequently characterized, it is possible to alter isolation procedures to bias the isolation toward phages with desirable characteristics. Some of these variations are regularly used by some groups while others have only been shown in a few publications. In this review I will describe (1) isolation procedures and variations that are designed to isolate phages with broader host ranges, (2) characterization procedures used to show that a phage may have utility in phage therapy, including some of the limits of such characterization, and (3) results of a survey and discussion with phage researchers in industry and academia on the practice of characterization of phages.},

	abstract = {Safe reuse of wastewater requires high levels of pathogen inactivation. Ozone is a very effective disinfectant for viruses and has distinct benefits over other forms of disinfectants, in that it increases the clarity of water and can oxidize some chemical contaminants in water. However, because of the combination of high ozone demand of most wastewaters and rapid reaction with viruses, determination of ozone dose in wastewater and recycled water treatment is not well defined. While various surrogates are used as indicator organisms for human pathogenic viruses in water reuse practice, much less is known about the relationship between surrogates and human pathogenic viruses for ozone disinfection in wastewater. In this study, the ozone inactivation dose response of several surrogates (Escherichia coli, coliphage T1, T4, PRD-1, ΦX174, and MS2) and human pathogenic viruses (poliovirus 1, echovirus 11, coxsackievirus B5, and adenovirus 2) were compared for the first time in secondary effluent wastewater. A unique reduction equivalent dose method was proposed to compare the inactivation of the microorganisms studied across waters with varying ozone demand. Inactivation of all viruses and surrogates studied was greater than 4 log at ozone Ct levels of less than 1 (mg/L)-min. E. coli and PRD-1 were identified as conservative surrogates for indicating inactivation of human pathogenic viruses in ozone disinfection of wastewater, providing a tool for practitioners and regulators to confidently accept ozonation systems for virus inactivation in wastewater reuse.},

In preparation for future extensive, large-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1\% and 0.5\% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by {\textgreater}4.8 log after only 1-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5\% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus.},

The oscillators are designed to operate at 9.2 GHz using the conventional and novel hairpin resonators, to compare the phase noise performance. The measurement shows an output power of 9.78 dBm and 10.87 dBm, respectively. The phase noise of the oscillator using the novel resonator shows -101.49 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, which is better than that of the conventional resonator by 6.17 dB.},

This corresponds to a total radiated power of 10.3 w , or 103mW per device. This is the largest recorded output power for a grid oscillator. The grid drain-source bias voltage is 7.4V and the total drain current for the grid is 6.0A, resulting in an overall dc-to-rf efficiency of 23\%. The pattern of the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio was measured and found to be essentially independent of the radiation angle. The average SSB noise level was -87 dBc/Hz at an offset of 150 kHz from the carrier. An average improvement in the SSB noise-to-carrier ratio of 5 dB was measured for a 100-transistor grid compared to a 16-transistor grid.},

We controlled various polymerization conditions, such as polymerization temperature, initiator concentration, suspending agent concentration, agitation speed, and VAc/water ratio, and obtained PVAc with a maximum conversion of VAc into PVAc of over 95–98\%. PVA beads having various molecular parameters were prepared by continuous saponification of PVAc microspheres. Despite our employing a one-batch process, a maximum degree of saponification of 99.9\% could be obtained. Continuous heterogeneous saponification of prepared PVAc yielded HMW PVA having a number-average degree of polymerization of 2,500–5,500, a syndiotactic diad content of 51–52\%, and degree of saponification of 85.0–99.9\%.},

The recent revolutionary technical advances in imaging, sequencing and lipid analysis have significantly boosted the depth and volume of knowledge on these viruses. This has resulted in new concepts of virus assembly, understanding of virion stability and dynamics, and the description of novel processes for viral genome packaging and membrane-driven genome delivery to the host. The detailed analyses of such processes have given novel insights into DNA transport across the protein-rich lipid bilayer and the transformation of spherical membrane structures into tubular nanotubes, resulting in the description of unexpectedly dynamic functions of the membrane structures. Membrane-containing phages have provided a framework for understanding virus evolution. The original observation on membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD1 and human pathogenic adenovirus has been fundamental in delineating the concept of “viral lineages”, postulating that the fold of the major capsid protein can be used as an evolutionary fingerprint to trace long-distance evolutionary relationships that are unrecognizable from the primary sequences. This has brought the early evolutionary paths of certain eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal viruses together, and potentially enables the reorganization of the nearly immeasurable virus population ({\textasciitilde}1 × 1031) on Earth into a reasonably low number of groups representing different architectural principles. In addition, the research on membrane-containing phages can support the development of novel tools and strategies for human therapy and crop protection.},

	abstract = {In the spirit of Open Source Hardware, Dremelfuge is now Open Source Hardware, according to the 0.3 standard found here: http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW
DremelFuge is a printable rotor for centrifuging standard microcentrifuge tubes and miniprep columns. Compared to the cost of a new centrifuge (priced by a fellow Thingiversian at \$500 minimum on Froogle), a Dremelfuge is incredibly cheap. It can be used for DIYbio ( http://www.diybio.org ) or for some culinary uses. It requires industry standard 1.5ml/2ml Eppendorf/Microcentrifuge tubes.
Used with a drill at 3000 RPM, the Dremelfuge will deliver over 400g, enough to comfortably spin down Miniprep samples (proven personally). It will likely achieve acceptable results at lower speeds, too.
Used at 10krpm, on a Rotary tool for instance, a Dremelfuge should deliver over 4400g, more than enough to spin down bacterial cells.
At 16krpm, Dremelfuge matches commercial centrifuges.
On a Dremel 300, a maximum speed of 33krpm equates to a force of over 50,000 times earth's gravity, which puts it into so-called "Ultracentrifuge" territory. The latest version (as printed by Shapeways) has successfully spun tubes at this speed.
To see some picures of Dremelfuge used to spin down cells, see here:http://letters.cunningprojects.com/?p=85

A video of me using Dremelfuge practically in a tent, to extract DNA from a banana: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnyFwupk5KA
Dremelfuge is available for sale as a high-quality, robust print on Shapeways.com in two editions, each suited for up to six samples at a time: Dremelfuge Recessed Edition, to fit the cutting-tool-holder commonly found with rotary tools (5mm diameter bore), and Dremelfuge Chuck Edition, which can be quickly adapted for use in any machine with a chuck grip. They are both available here on my Shapeways shop:http://shapeways.com/shops/labsfromfabs
Dremelfuge, as with any high-speed rotary tool, may cause personal harm or damage to property or persons in case of failure, and no guarantee, warranty, promise or suggestion of safety is made or offered by me (Cathal Garvey) with regard to DremelFuge.

	abstract = {A major limitation with traditional phage preparations is the variability in titer, salts, and bacterial contaminants between successive propagations. Here we introduce the Phage On Tap (PoT) protocol for the quick and efficient preparation of homogenous bacteriophage (phage) stocks. This method produces homogenous, laboratory-scale, high titer (up to 1010–11 PFU·ml−1), endotoxin reduced phage banks that can be used to eliminate the variability between phage propagations and improve the molecular characterizations of phage. The method consists of five major parts, including phage propagation, phage clean up by 0.22 μm filtering and chloroform treatment, phage concentration by ultrafiltration, endotoxin removal, and the preparation and storage of phage banks for continuous laboratory use. From a starting liquid lysate of {\textgreater} 100 mL, the PoT protocol generated a clean, homogenous, laboratory phage bank with a phage recovery efficiency of 85\% within just two days. In contrast, the traditional method took upwards of five days to produce a high titer, but lower volume phage stock with a recovery efficiency of only 4\%. Phage banks can be further purified for the removal of bacterial endotoxins, reducing endotoxin concentrations by over 3,000-fold while maintaining phage titer. The PoT protocol focused on T-like phages, but is broadly applicable to a variety of phages that can be propagated to sufficient titer, producing homogenous, high titer phage banks that are applicable for molecular and cellular assays.},

Studies have found a relationship among temperature, humidity, and influenza virus incidence, transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity. Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets. Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high ({\textgreater}85\%) and low ({\textless}60\%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (∼60 to 85\%). At an AH of less than 22 g · m-3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g · m-3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude. At a fixed RH of 75\%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19°C and 25°C. We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity. The model explained 83\% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets. This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets.IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses are responsible for a number of infectious diseases resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year in the United States. There has been a lively debate in the literature over whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) modulates virus infectivity. We designed a controlled study and used advanced statistical modeling techniques specifically to address this question. By providing an improved understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and virus infectivity, our work will ultimately lead to improved strategies for predicting and controlling disease transmission.},

	abstract = {There are an estimated 1031 bacteriophages (phage), viruses that infect bacteria, on earth, thus comprising a significant portion of the biosphere. Of these, a mere 10,733 phages have been isolated and 2,061 phages have sequenced, complete genomes, with even fewer, only 1,073, presently publicly available in the NCBI GenBank database. “Phagehunting” is the process of isolation, characterization, and genomic analyses of phages that infect bacterial hosts. There is considerable interest in using phages as diagnostics and therapeutics of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. One such MDR bacterium is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB, whose phages can be isolated on the easy-to-grow non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. Since current phagehunting procedures of Mycobacterium phages all use identical plating conditions, we would like to explore alternative phagehunting procedures to determine if that affects the type of phages isolated. To date, no phages within the Podoviridae family have been isolated that infect Mycobacteria. With these new optimized procedures, we would like to pilot a program, contingent on the success of this study, to expose high school students to the field of molecular and synthetic genomics. We examined the precise conditions required in each step of the phagehunting process to successfully obtain phage. With the use of careful phage isolation procedures and environmental samples from various locations, such as alternative media usage and modified plaque-picking methods, we isolated potentially novel phages. One of these phages, Kalon1, has been isolated and preliminarily characterized. The success of this study may provide the foundation for an improved program for high school students to foster their interest in research and gain invaluable experiences outside of the classroom while providing bacteriophages that can serve as the base chassis of synthetically engineered phages for diagnosis and treatment of MDR pathogens. Lastly, by creating a generalizable standardized process to obtain phages, we may broaden the horizon for new exploration of novel phages and advances in phage therapy of any MDR pathogen.},

	abstract = {Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors are widely used for determining liquid properties or probing interfacial processes. For some applications the sensitivity of the QCM sensors typically used (5–20 MHz) is limited compared with other biosensor methods. In this study ultrasensitive QCM sensors with resonant frequencies from 39 to 110 MHz for measurements in the liquid phase are presented. The fundamental sensor effect of a QCM is the decrease of the resonant frequency of an oscillating quartz crystal due to the binding of mass on a coated surface during the measurement. The sensitivity of QCM sensors increases strongly with an increasing resonant frequency and, therefore, with a decreasing thickness of the sensitive area. The new kind of ultrasensitive QCM sensors used in this study is based on chemically milled shear mode quartz crystals which are etched only in the center of the blank, forming a thin quartz membrane with a thick, mechanically stable outer ring. An immunoassay using a virus specific monoclonal antibody and a M13-Phage showed an increase in the signal to noise ratio by a factor of more than 6 for 56 MHz quartz crystals compared with standard 19 MHz quartz crystals, the detection limit was improved by a factor of 200. Probing of acoustic properties of glycerol/water mixtures resulted in an increase in sensitivity, which is in very good agreement with theory. Chemically milled QCM sensors strongly improve the sensitivity in biosensing and probing of acoustic properties and, therefore, offer interesting new application fields for QCM sensors.},

Taken together, the resulting values are most compatible with triangulation numbers T = 13 and Q = 21 for both T2 and T4, thus confirming the previously proposed capsid architecture of T4 revealed by indirect measurements and thereby eliminating the repeatedly reported discrepancy between T2 and T4 in favor of a common Q number of 21 corresponding to 960 copies of gp23*.},

Six long tail fibers are attached to the baseplate’s periphery and are the host cell’s recognition sensors. The sheath and the baseplate undergo large conformational changes during infection.

This is 25\% less than the prohead mass deduced from its polypeptide composition, and this finding implies that the bacteriophage T4 prohead is built of fewer polypeptide copies than previously reported. In contrast, the mass of mature heads measured by STEM, 194 ± 2 MDa, is in agreement with previous mass measurements of DNA and protein content, and it is consistent with the previously determined stoichiometry. This good agreement of average STEM values for proheads and mature heads with corresponding hydrodynamic measurements suggests that STEM allows faithful evaluation of the masses of large supramolecular assemblies (i.e., ⩾200 MDa) such as whole viruses or cellular organelles.},

	abstract = {A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model, proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model, including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular assemblies of unknown atomic structure.},

With this aim, both biocomponents have been immobilised in parallel onto interdigitated gold microelectrodes. The produced surfaces have been characterised by EIS and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy and have been applied to bacteria detection. Compared to immunocapture, detection using phages generates successive dual signals of opposite trend over time, which consist of an initial increase in impedance caused by bacteria capture followed by impedance decrease attributed to phage-induced lysis. Such dual signals can be easily distinguished from those caused by non-speciﬁc adsorption and/or crossbinding, which helps to circumvent one of the main drawbacks of reagentless biosensors based in a single target-binding event. The described strategy has generated speciﬁc detection of Escherichia coli in the range of 104–107 CFU mL−1 and minimal interference by non-target Lactobacillus. We propose that the utilisation of phages as capture biocomponent for bacteria capture and EIS detection allows in-chip signal conﬁrmation.},

They are found to be the n = 4N-2 modes of the longitudinal modes of the nanorods, where N is an integer starting from 1 and n is the mode order quantum number. This study was confirmed by measuring the microwave absorption spectra of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), which is a rod-shaped virus. This is also the first study to identify the “dipolar-like” mode in a rod-shaped nano-object. Our study is not only an important step to achieve rapid and sensitive detection of rod-shaped viruses based on their microwave spectroscopic features and a non-contact method to measure the Young’s modulus of rod-shaped viruses, but also is critical to formulate an efficient epidemic prevention strategy to deactivate viruses with the structure-resonant microwaves.},

It is shown that when phase shifters are used within the architecture of the array, the focal point moves as a function of frequency, which degrades the focusing performance of the antenna. To mitigate these limitations, time-delay units are proposed, and it is revealed that perfect focusing across a wide bandwidth can be achieved by this approach. To validate this concept, an UWB Vivaldi focused antenna array using time delays is designed which demonstrates good focusing capability across the UWB spectrum.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the design and the experimental validation of a polarization reconfigurable microstrip phased array is presented. The reconfigurability between the right-handed (RHCP) and left-handed (LHCP) circular polarization is achieved using electronic switches (PIN diodes) combined with truncated corners microstrip radiators. In the design, special attention was given to the matter of reducing back lobe radiation effects using the concept of asymmetric positioning of the radiators with respect to the ground plane. Afterward, the main lobe axial ratio behavior for several beam steering and side lobe level conditions are investigated. Finally, the polarization reconfigurability is achieved and the design is validated through the good agreement between theoretical and experimental results.},

	abstract = {In this project we pursue the development of a novel miniature submillimeter-wave magnetron oscillator (SMO) which combined vacuum tube technology with solid-state microfabrication technology. The SMO is a compact, rugged and lightweight terahertz source capable of operating in the nearly unexplored near- and far-infrared electromagnetic spectrum. It will provide high power, highly efficient THz radiation for active illumination and/or local oscillators for applications in compact sensor arrays for THz imaging. Civilian applications of these devices include high-resolution radar, satellite telecommunications, remote sensing, line-of-sight networking, plasma and solid-state diagnostics, and high-speed computing. Other military applications of the SMO include line-of-sight networking and communications as well as chemical and biological spectroscopy. In the SMO, a tiny electron beam produced by a micron-sized cold-cathode interacts with the millimeter-wave fields of a miniature multi-vane cylindrical microcavity where the beam, as it rotates about the cavity axis, generates a terahertz signal inside the microcavity. The highly desirable features of the SMO, such as high power and its miniature size, make for an ultrahigh frequency vacuum microtube that has the potential to revolutionize the millimeter-wave tube industry. Once fully developed, the SMO should represent a multi-million dollar market.},

The ZnO films were obtained by 10 cycle spin-coated and dried zinc acetate films followed by annealing in air at 500–575°C. The films deposited on the Pyrex glass substrate were polycrystalline and c-axis oriented. A minimum film resistivity gave 28.2 Ω cm at an annealing temperature of 525°C. The temperature dependence of the conductivity indicated electron transport in the conduction band due to thermal excitation of donor electrons for temperatures from 250 to 300 K. The grain boundary scattering effect due to thermionic emission was confirmed. For temperatures below 250 K nearest-neighbor hopping conduction was dominant in the films. The films were transparent in the visible range above 400 nm and had sharp ultraviolet absorption edges at 380 nm. The absorption edge analysis revealed that the optical band gap energy for the films was 3.20–3.21 eV and the electronic transition was of the direct transition type. From the Urbach tail analysis the width of the localized state Ee=0.07–0.08 eV.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
Saliva contains a variety of host defense factors. It influences calculus formation and periodontal disease. Different studies have been done to find exact correlation of salivary biomarkers with periodontal disease. With a multitude of biomarkers and complexities in their determination, the salivary pH may be tried to be used as a quick chairside test. The aim of this study was to analyze the pH of saliva and determine its relevance to the severity of periodontal disease.

Study Design:
The study population consisted of 300 patients. They were divided into three groups of 100 patients each: Group A had clinically healthy gingiva, Group B who had generalized chronic gingivitis and Group C who had generalized chronic periodontitis. The randomized unstimulated saliva from each patient was collected and pH was tested. Data was analyzed statistically using analysis of variance technique.

Results:
The salivary pH was more alkaline for patients with generalized chronic gingivitis as compared with the control group (P = 0.001) whereas patients with generalized chronic periodontitis had more acidic pH as compared with the control group (P = 0.001).

Conclusion:
These results indicate a significant change in the pH depending on the severity of the periodontal condition. The salivary pH shows significant changes and thus relevance to the severity of periodontal disease. Salivary pH may thus be used as a quick chairside diagnostic biomarker.},

The measured Young's modulus (≈1.8 GPa) is comparable with that of hard plastic. We also observe fatigue and breakage of capsids after probing them repetitively.

For the ion distribution analysis the capsid’s structure was identical and fixed in both simulations. It was then released for the stability analysis. The ion distribution demonstrated two types of the local regions on the inner surface of the capsid’s wall: highly occupied with chloride ions in both systems despite a largely uniform electrostatic potential everywhere on the surface, and the regions that loose almost all chloride ions in the unstable capsid. The latter regions are located close to the cracks that are formed when the capsid is destabilised and thus could initiate the collapse of the capsid.},

	abstract = {Current virus detection methods often take significant time or can be limited in sensitivity and specificity. The increasing frequency and magnitude of viral outbreaks in recent decades has resulted in an urgent need for diagnostic methods that are facile, sensitive, rapid and inexpensive. Here, we describe and characterise a novel, calcium-mediated interaction of the surface of enveloped viruses with DNA, that can be used for the functionalisation of intact virus particles via chemical groups attached to the DNA. Using DNA modified with fluorophores, we have demonstrated the rapid and sensitive labelling and detection of influenza and other viruses using single-particle tracking and particle-size determination. With this method, we have detected clinical isolates of influenza in just one minute, significantly faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests. This powerful technique is easily extendable to a wide range of other enveloped pathogenic viruses and holds significant promise as a future diagnostic tool.},

Extensive investigations were carried out with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic purified DNA samples utilizing some of the most sensitive and precision instrumentation and methods available, while scanning the whole spectral region from 1Hz to 100KHz (in the low frequencies) and all the way to the high-frequency region of 100MHz (including investigations on the effects of 100MHz high-frequency fields as well as 2.4GHz microwave fields on the DNA). We were unable to detect any electromagnetism of any kind intrinsic to the DNA or its coupling to external noise sources, whether concentrated or diluted in water, as compared to control samples (H2O or empty chambers), neither existence of any possible spontaneous or stimulated/induced electromagnetic fields or waves emanated from both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic genetic material. Based on our measurements, we conclude that either there is no intrinsic electromagnetic activity or fields present in the DNA material, in both concentrated or diluted form, or any such activity is extremely weak in its intensity and beyond the measurement limits of current scientific methods.},

Our results show that E. coli DNA absorbs microwaves in the 8–12-GHz region substantially more efficiently than water, which is itself an extremely efficient absorber.

Irradiation by visible light solidified the aqueous solution. In addition, when the solution was cast on a plate, dried and photo-irradiated in the presence of a photomask a micropattern was formed that matched the micropattern on the photomask. The gelatin-immobilized regions enhanced cell adhesion. It was also confirmed that the gelatin incorporating furfuryl and Rose Bengal have no significant toxicity. The photo-crosslinkable gelatin was employed as a direct pulp capping material in the dental field.

	abstract = {Rice flour dispersions, under suitable conditions of processing, can form a gel. The effect of concentration of solids (10–18\%) and time (0–75 min) of processing on textural attributes, and viscoelasticity were investigated along with sensory attributes. The textural attribute determined is gel strength, while viscoelasticity was determined in terms of mechanical spectra like storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), complex viscosity (η*) and loss factor (tan δ) during a frequency sweep varying from 0.01 to 40 Hz at a constant stress of 25 Pa. Microstructural observation indicates the swelling of starch granules in the beginning of heating, while damaged granule and leached-out materials are visible at the end of the gelling process. Desirability function analysis has been applied to obtain a rice gel with acceptable textural attributes; a solid concentration of 15.2\% and a heating time of 75 min can lead to the development of a gel with a satisfaction level of 0.6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Rice flour gels in the form of hard-set gels, porridges and spreads are popular in several parts of the world particularly for feeding of infants and children. The application of the present study lies in understanding the role of major processing variables on the quality attributes and viscoelasticity of a product, characterization of cooked gels and for developing rice flour-based food gels. The findings may also be extended for the development of other cereal-based gels.},

The method uses a rapid thermoresponsive gel system to solve the problem of inefficient drying within the conventional gelcasting procedure. The gel system of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) gel containing poly-(ethylene oxide) graft chains with a freely mobile end was taken as an example for thermoresponsive gelcasting of alumina. The gelling behavior of organic aqueous solution was evaluated. The slurries (solids loading, 50 vol\%) with the new gelcasting system were prepared. The wetting ceramic parts were almost completely dried in 70 min at 50°C. The microstructure of the green body is homogeneous. The flexural strength of the sintered ceramics is 282 ± 37 MPa with a theoretical density of 97.6\%.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods in drying ceramic parts, using dry air or gas with particular conditions of humidity and temperature, is usually confronted with many difficulties. Non-uniform and differential drying in various regions due to the solvent gradient, induces structural and residual stresses which cause defects, such as cracking, warpage, bending and the other malformations, which make the articles useless. These malformations can be minimised or eliminated by using the liquid desiccant drying method due to the release of residual stresses. In this work, gelcast green parts have been brought in contact with an appropriate liquid desiccant with the purpose of withdrawing above 30 wt.\% solvent in a reasonable period of time, i.e. 3 h. The effects of factors such as loading level of ceramic powders, liquid desiccant concentration and its gradient, effective thickness and geometry of parts and type of liquid desiccant solution (aqueous or non-aqueous), on the drying rate were studied. Lower solid content in the gel, higher liquid desiccant concentration and lower effective thickness of parts, increase the drying rate. Decrease of aspect ratio in cylindrical parts changes the diffusion mechanism from radial to longitudinal direction. Drying of parts in aqueous solution of PEG1000 is more homogeneous than the non-aqueous one, but drying rate of parts in non-aqueous solution of PEG1000 is greater than the aqueous one.},

	abstract = {Turbidity describes the cloudiness, or clarity, of a liquid. It is a principal indicator of water quality, sensitive to any suspended solids present. Prior work has identified the lack of low-cost turbidity monitoring as a significant hurdle to overcome to improve water quality in many domains, especially in the developing world. Low-cost hand-held benchtop meters have been proposed. This work adapts and verifies the technology for continuous monitoring. Lab tests show the low-cost continuous monitor can achieve 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) accuracy in the range 0–100 NTU and costs approximately 64 USD in components to construct. This level of accuracy yields useful and actionable data about water quality and may be sufficient in certain applications where cost is a primary constraint. A 38-day continuous monitoring trial, including a step change in turbidity, showed promising results with a median error of 0.45 and 1.40 NTU for two different monitors. However, some noise was present in the readings resulting in a standard deviation of 1.90 and 6.55 NTU, respectively. The cause was primarily attributed to ambient light and bubbles in the piping. By controlling these noise sources, we believe the low-cost continuous turbidity monitor could be a useful tool in multiple domains.},

We show surface-induced correlations, excluded volume, and electrostatic forces are sufficient to predict most of the major features of the current structural data for DNA packaged within viral capsids without additional ordering due to elastic bending forces for the polymer. Current models assume highly-ordered, even spooled, hexagonally packed conformations based on interpretation of cryo-EM density maps. We show herein that the surface induced packing of short (6mer), unconnected DNA polymer segments is the only necessary ingredient in creating ringed densities consistent with experimental density maps. This implies the ensemble of possible conformations of polymeric DNA within the capsid that are consistent with cryo-EM data may be much larger than implied by traditional interpretations where such rings can only result from highly-ordered spool-like conformations. This opens the possibility of a more disordered, entropically-driven view of phage packaging thermodynamics. We also show the electrostatics of the DNA contributes a large portion of the internal hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of a phage virion, suggesting that nonlinear elastic anomalies might reduce the overall elastic bending enthalpy of more disordered conformations to have allowable free energies.},

We have applied methods primarily based on atomic force microscopy and finite element modeling that allow precise investigation of the mechanical properties of the influenza virus lipid envelope. The mechanical properties of small, spherical vesicles made from PR8 influenza lipids were probed by an atomic force microscopy tip applying forces up to 0.2 nN, which led to an elastic deformation up to 20\%, on average. The liposome deformation was modeled using finite element methods to extract the lipid bilayer elastic properties. We found that influenza liposomes were softer than what would be expected for a gel phase bilayer and highly deformable: Consistent with previous suggestion that influenza lipids do not undergo a major phase transition, we observe that the stiffness of influenza liposomes increases gradually and weakly (within one order of magnitude) with temperature. Surprisingly, influenza liposomes were, in most cases, able to withstand wall-to-wall deformation, and forces {\textgreater}1 nN were generally required to puncture the influenza envelope, which is similar to viral protein shells. Hence, the choice of a highly flexible lipid envelope may provide as efficient a protection for a viral genome as a stiff protein shell.},

Both the onset and peak temperatures of the modified samples increased while the endothermic enthalpy change decreased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05). Meanwhile, dry heating remarkably increased the apparent viscosities of both GRF and GRS. Importantly, compared with GRS samples, the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G") values of modified GRF increased more greatly and the tanδ values decreased more remarkably, indicating that the dry-heat treatment showed more impact on the GRF and a higher viscoelasticity compared with GRS. Our results suggest the dry-heat treatment of GRF is a more effective method than that of GRS, which omits the complex and tedious process for purifying GRS, and thereby has more practical applications in the food industry.},

The results showed that the dosage of GRF had evident effect on both gelcasting process and the final dielectric properties of CCTO ceramics. CCTO ceramics from the green body solidified with 3.5 wt\% GRF showed relatively optimal dielectric properties, namely a dielectric constant up to 1.60 × 104 and a loss of only 0.063 (at 1 kHz test frequency).

To do this, we scanned a train of focused femtosecond laser pulses over the complex film in air, following which the non-irradiated complex was removed by rinsing the substrates with ethanol. A minimum line width of 6.1 \&micro;m was obtained at a laser-pulse energy of 0.156 nJ and scanning speeds of 500 and 1000 \&micro;m/s. This line width is significantly smaller than that obtained in previous work using a CO2 laser. In addition, the lines are electrically conducting. However, the minimum resistivity of the line pattern was 2.43 \&times; 10\&minus;6 \&Omega;\&middot;m, which is {\textasciitilde}10 times greater than that of the pattern formed using the CO2 laser. An X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that the balance between reduction and re-oxidation of the glyoxylic acid Cu complex determines the nature of the highly reduced Cu patterns in the ambient air.},

Moreover, for a reliability approach, physico-chemical interactions in the whole micro-assembly have to be considered.

Solar cells produced with these ‘passivated copper busbars’ have shown increased conversion efficiency due to an improved device operating voltage and current while maintaining a similar fill factor when compared to cells with standard ‘fired-through’ silver busbars. In addition to the improved cell efficiency, the use of copper paste may provide major cost savings compared to the use of silver, potentially giving a very significant reduction in cost per Watt. 60-cell modules have been produced at Trina Solar with passivated copper busbars, showing similar performance to the reference modules with silver busbars. Module reliability has been shown to be well in excess of the IEC 61215 standard requirements.},

The Wilkinson design can also be used as a power combiner because it is made up of passive components and hence reciprocal. First published by Ernest J. Wilkinson in 1960, this circuit finds wide use in radio frequency communication systems utilizing multiple channels since the high degree of isolation between the output ports prevents crosstalk between the individual channels.
It uses quarter wave transformers, which can be  easily fabricated as quarter wave lines on printed circuit boards. It is also possible to use other forms of transmission line (e.g. coaxial cable) or lumped circuit elements (inductors and capacitors).},

Flash white light irradiation energy and the power of NIR/deep UV were optimized to obtain high conductivity Cu films. Several microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were employed to characterize the Cu nano-films. Optimally sintered Cu nano-ink films produced using a deep UV-assisted flash white light sintering technique had the lowest resistivity (7.62 μΩ·cm), which was only 4.5-fold higher than that of bulk Cu film (1.68 μΩ•cm).},

An in situ vacuum encapsulation employing recessed cavities by isotropic RIE (reactive ion etch) method and an electron beam evaporated molybdenum vacuum seal are implemented to fabricate the new field emitter triode. The superb field emitter characteristics are probably due to sub-micron dimension device structure and the pencil type lateral cathode tip employing upper and lower LOCOS oxidation.},

This miniature pre-vacuum pump is realized as two-electrode siliconglass structure. Thanks to a very close inter-electrode distance it is possible to ignite a gas discharge even at 1000 hPa at voltage lower than 1000 V. The use of a silicon substrate as a getter material increases significantly pumping capacity. This pump is technologically compatible with earlier developed high vacuum micropump and after their integration they could cover a very wide pressure range from 1000 hPa down to 10−7 hPa. This would enable on-chip generation of vacuum in variety of miniaturized devices.},

However, by making devices from epitaxially grown III–V layers that are separated from a growth substrate, one can recycle the growth substrate to reduce costs. Here, we show damage-free removal of an epitaxial single-crystal GaAs film from its GaAs growth substrate using a laser that is absorbed by a smaller band gap, pseudomorphic indium gallium arsenide nitride layer grown between the substrate and the GaAs film. The liftoff process transfers the GaAs film to a flexible polymer substrate, and the transferred GaAs layer is indistinguishable in structural quality from its growth substrate.},

Fecal coliphage was detected in a dose-dependent way in volunteers orally exposed to phage. All volunteers receiving the higher phage dose showed fecal phage 1 day after exposure; this prevalence was only 50\% in subjects receiving the lower phage dose. No fecal phage was detectable a week after a 2-day course of oral phage application. Oral phage application did not cause a decrease in total fecal E. coli counts. In addition, no substantial phage T4 replication on the commensal E. coli population was observed. No adverse events related to phage application were reported. Serum transaminase levels remained in the normal range, and neither T4 phage nor T4-specific antibodies were observed in the serum of the subjects at the end of the study. This is, to our knowledge, the first safety test in the recent English literature which has measured the bioavailability of oral phage in humans and is thus a first step to the rational evaluation of phage therapy for diarrheal diseases.},

However, steam autoclaves typically used for this purpose may not be readily accessible to everyone in the scientific community, such as K-12 teachers, researchers in the field, students in under-funded laboratories, or persons in the developing world who lack funding and resources. This work examines the use of commercial electric pressure cookers as an alternative method for the sterilization of media, instruments, and waste. Four commonly available brands of pressure cooker were tested for their ability to sterilize microbiological media, a variety of metal instruments, and high-titer microbial cultures. All four pressure cookers were able to sterilize these starting materials as well as a range of microbial types, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, filamentous fungi, unicellular fungi, and mixed environmental samples. Only the Instant Pot, however, was able to sterilize autoclave tester ampoules of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores. These results suggest that, depending on the nature of the work undertaken, store-bought pressure cookers can be an appropriate substitute for commercial autoclaves. Their adoption may also help increase the accessibility of science to a broader range of investigators.},

	abstract = {The facultative anaerobic bacterium Escherichia coli is frequently forced to adapt to changing environmental conditions. One important determinant for metabolism is the availability of oxygen allowing a more efficient metabolism. Especially in large scale bioreactors, the distribution of oxygen is inhomogeneous and individual cells encounter frequent changes. This might contribute to observed yield losses during process upscaling. Short-term gene expression data exist of an anaerobic E. coli batch culture shifting to aerobic conditions. The data reveal temporary upregulation of genes that are less efficient in terms of energy conservation than the genes predicted by conventional flux balance analyses. In this study, we provide evidence for a positive correlation between metabolic fluxes and gene expression. We then hypothesize that the more efficient enzymes are limited by their low expression, restricting flux through their reactions. We define a demand that triggers expression of the demanded enzymes that we explicitly include in our model. With these features we propose a method, demand-directed dynamic flux balance analysis, dddFBA, bringing together elements of several previously published methods. The introduction of additional flux constraints proportional to gene expression provoke a temporary demand for less efficient enzymes, which is in agreement with the transient upregulation of these genes observed in the data. In the proposed approach, the applied objective function of growth rate maximization together with the introduced constraints triggers expression of metabolically less efficient genes. This finding is one possible explanation for the yield losses observed in large scale bacterial cultivations where steady oxygen supply cannot be warranted.},

However, growth was essentially equal at the equal sulfite-oxidation rates when these were determined in the presence of killed whole cultures. Specific growth rates were reduced only at oxygen-supply rates much lower than those at which the total amount of growth was reduced.

The cell counts and viabilities were nonsignificantly decreased for cells cultivated in AutoFlasks in automated handling. The proliferation of manual and automated bioscreening by the WST-1 assay showed a nonsignificant lower proliferation of automatically disseminated cells associated with a mostly lower standard error. The disseminated suspension cell lines showed different pronounced proliferations in descending order, starting with Jurkat cells followed by SEM, Molt4, and RS4 cells having the lowest proliferation.

	abstract = {Virtually all studies of phage infections investigate bacteria growing exponentially in rich media. In nature, however, phages largely encounter non-growing cells. Bacteria entering stationary phase often activate well-studied stress defense mechanisms that drastically alter the cell, facilitating its long-term survival. An understanding of phage-host interactions in such conditions is of major importance from both an ecological and therapeutic standpoint. Here, we show that bacteriophage T4 can efficiently bind to, infect and kill E. coli in stationary phase, both in the presence and absence of a functional stationary-phase sigma factor, and explore the response of T4-infected stationary phase cells to the addition of fresh nutrients 5 or 24 hours after that infection. An unexpected new mode of response has been identified. “Hibernation” mode is a persistent but reversible dormant state in which the infected cells make at least some phage enzymes, but halt phage development until appropriate nutrients become available before producing phage particles. Our evidence indicates that the block in hibernation mode occurs after the middle-mode stage of phage development; host DNA breakdown and the incorporation of the released nucleotides into phage DNA indicate that the enzymes of the nucleotide synthesizing complex, under middle-mode control, have been made and assembled into a functional state. Once fresh glucose and amino acids become available, the standard lytic infection process rapidly resumes and concentrations of up to 1011 progeny phage (an average of about 40 phage per initially-present cell) are produced. All evidence is consistent with the hibernation-mode control point lying between middle mode and late mode T4 gene expression. We have also observed a “scavenger” response, where the infecting phage takes advantage of whatever few nutrients are available to produce small quantities of progeny within 2 to 5 hours after infection. The scavenger response seems able to produce no more than an average of one phage per originally-available cell, and few if any further progeny are produced by cells in this mode even if fresh nutrients are made available later.},

Human epidemiological studies gave evidence of increased risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma. RF radiation was classified as Group 2B, a possible human carcinogen. Further epidemiological, animal and mechanistic studies have strengthened the association. In spite of this, in most countries little or nothing has been done to reduce exposure and educate people on health hazards from RF radiation. On the contrary ambient levels have increased. In 2014 the WHO launched a draft of a Monograph on RF fields and health for public comments. It turned out that five of the six members of the Core Group in charge of the draft are affiliated with International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an industry loyal NGO, and thus have a serious conflict of interest. Just as by ICNIRP, evaluation of non-thermal biological effects from RF radiation are dismissed as scientific evidence of adverse health effects in the Monograph. This has provoked many comments sent to the WHO. However, at a meeting on March 3, 2017 at the WHO Geneva office it was stated that the WHO has no intention to change the Core Group.},

Since that time, there has been a considerable body of science further addressing the relation between radiofrequency EMFs and adverse health outcomes, as well as significant developments in the technologies that use radiofrequency EMFs. Accordingly, ICNIRP has updated the radiofrequency EMF part of the 1998 Guidelines.

The problems of thermometry in the presence of electromagnetic fields fall outside the scope of this article. Their solution, however, is no less important to the future of clinical hyperthermia than the development of heating techniques. Finally, it should be remembered that physiological parameters such as blood flow have appreciable effects in determining the efficacy of the physical techniques described above.},

The natural frequencies of such resonances will, generally, be in the microwave frequency range. Some of these systems will be coupled to the electromagnetic field by the charge distributions they carry, thus admitting the possibility that microwave exposures may generate physiological effects in man and other species. However, such microwave excitable resonances are expected to be strongly damped by interaction with their aqueous biological environment. Although those dissipation mechanisms have been studied, the limitations on energy transfers that follow from the limited coupling of these resonances to the electromagnetic field have not generally been considered.

For Brownian Dynamics the friction has to be so strong that the particles' velocities are damped much faster than the duration of an integration timestep. Here we show that this conceptual limit can be dropped with an analytic integration of the equations of damped motion. In the resulting Langevin integration scheme our recently proposed approximate form of the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles can be incorparated conveniently, leading to a fast multi-particle propagation scheme, which captures more of the short-time and short-range solvent effects than standard BD. Comparing the dynamics of a bead-spring model of a short peptide, we recommend to run simulations of small biological molecules with the Langevin type finite damping and to include the hydrodynamic interactions.},

	abstract = {The biological effects of modulated radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields have been a subject of debate since early publications more than 30 years ago, suggesting that relatively weak amplitude-modulated RF electromagnetic fields have specific biological effects different from the well-known thermal effects of RF energy. This discussion has been recently activated by the increasing human exposure to RF fields from wireless communication systems. Modulation is used in all wireless communication systems to enable the signal to carry information. A previous review in 1998 indicated that experimental evidence for modulation-specific effects of RF energy is weak. This article reviews recent studies (published after 1998) on the biological effects of modulated RF fields. The focus is on studies that have compared the effects of modulated and unmodulated (continuous wave) RF fields, or compared the effects of different kinds of modulations; studies that used only one type of signal are not included. While the majority of recent studies have reported no modulation-specific effects, there are a few interesting exceptions indicating that there may be specific effects from amplitude-modulated RF fields on the human central nervous system. These findings warrant follow-up studies. Bioelectromagnetics 32:511–534, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We investigated possible genotoxic effects of HPPP EMF (8.8 GHz, 180 ns pulse width, peak power 65 kW, repetition rate 50 Hz) on erythrocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis. We used the alkaline comet assay, which is a highly sensitive method to assess DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile lesions. Blood samples were exposed to HPPP EMF for 40 min in rectangular wave guide. The speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) calculated from temperature kinetics was about 1.6 kW/kg (peak SAR was about 300 MW/kg). The temperature rise in the blood samples at steady state was 3.5 ± 0.1 ◦C. The data show that the increase in DNA damage after exposure of erythrocytes to HPPP EMF was induced by the rise in temperature in the exposed cell suspension. This was conﬁrmed in experiments in which cells were incubated for 40 min under the corresponding temperature conditions. The results allow us to conclude that HPPP EMF-exposure at the given modality did not cause any a-thermal genotoxic effect on frog erythrocytes in vitro.},

A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.

	abstract = {Mature particles of bacteriophage lambda are composed of about equal amounts of protein and DNA. Each phage contains one double-stranded DNA molecule encapsulated in an icosahedral head, which is about 50 nm (0.05 μ) in diameter; a flexible tubular tail, which is about 150 nm (0.15 μ) long and terminates in a fiber, projects from the head (Kellenberger and Edgar, 1971). Lambda is an obligatory parasite of Escherichia coli. Growth begins when a phage particle attaches to the host by the tip of its tail and injects its DNA molecule. Lambda is a temperate phage and, thus, can multiply in E. coli by one of three ways: (1) In productive growth, the injected DNA molecule directs the synthesis of numerous gene products; these promote replication of the phage DNA, synthesis of the phage heads and tails, packaging of the DNA into mature phage particles, and eventual lysis of the cell. At 37°C it takes about 40 minutes for a lytic cycle, and about 100 infective progeny phage are produced. (2) Lambda DNA can also persist in the host cell as a prophage and replicate passively as an integral part of the bacterial genome. In this case the injected DNA must first direct the synthesis of the gene products that promote its linear insertion into the genome of the host. Next, it turns on the synthesis of the repressor, which blocks transcription of those genes responsible for autonomous lambda DNA replication and most other phage functions.},

Exposure to low pH triggers the E proteins to undergo conformational changes, which precede fusion with the host cell membrane and release of the viral genome. The ﬂavivirus membrane exhibits signiﬁcant local curvature and deformation, as revealed by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), but its precise structure and interactions with envelope components remain unclear. We now report simulations of the dengue viral particle that reﬁne its envelope structure in unprecedented detail. Our ﬁnal models are morphologically consistent with cryo-EM data, and reveal the structural basis for membrane curvature. Electrostatic interactions increased envelope complex stability; this coupling has potential functional signiﬁcance in the context of the viral fusion mechanism and infective states.},

In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS‐CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS‐CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS‐CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS. SARS‐CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle. These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS‐CoV may also be targets of SARS‐CoV infection. The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS‐CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS‐CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways. This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS. Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. The morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the S protein of SARSCoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated. This state revealed by cryo-EM first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.},

	abstract = {[spa] Los virus son entidades biológicas relativamente simples, pero muy eficientes. En su forma más simple están constituidos por una cadena de material genético protegida por una cubierta de proteínas llamada cápside, cuya formación y propiedades juegan un papel crucial en el ciclo vital de los virus. Un mayor conocimiento de la física que se esconde tras los virus permitiría no sólo combatirlos, sino también usarlos para aplicaciones útiles en disciplinas como la medicina, nanociencia o farmacia. En esta tesis nos hemos centrado en la caracterización física de las propiedades mecánicas y el autoensamblaje de la cápsida de virus esféricos con simetría icosaédrica. Para ello hemos propuesto un modelo de grano-grueso basado en un potencial de interacción sencillo entre las subunidades estructurales de la cápsida. Los parámetros del modelo están directamente relacionados con propiedades físicamente relevantes y que pueden ser medibles experimentalmente, como son la curvatura espontánea de la cápside y la constante elástica de flexión. Estos dos ingredientes son cruciales para determinar la arquitectura y el tamaño de los virus. Con este nuevo modelo, hemos hecho simulaciones usando diferentes técnicas para reproducir y estudiar experimentos de auto-ensamblaje. En particular, hemos analizado el rango de parámetros y las condiciones adecuadas que determinan la forma y la estabilidad de las distintas estructuras de los virus. También hemos analizado la cinética de autoensamblaje y los pasos intermedios de la formación de virus, inaccesibles experimentalmente por las características del proceso. Además hemos determinado la importancia de la geometría y más concretamente del número de triangulación y la clase en la respuesta mecánica y en la tendencia a cambiar de forma durante el proceso de maduración. Este cambio de forma conlleva una mayor rigidez y tolerancia a la presión, que puede aportar ventajas biológicas especialmente en virus de ADN de doble cadena. Finalmente, hemos desarrollado modelos de elementos finitos y simulaciones discretas para interpretar experimentos de nanoindentación con AFM. Con ellos hemos estudiado la ruptura y la dureza de la cápside del bacteriófago T7 orientada según los diferentes ejes de simetría icosaédrica, y desarrollado un método para determinar la presión interna en el bacteriófago phi29.},

These effects are found to be extremely important and substantial, introducing qualitative changes in the charge state of the capsid such as a transition from net-positive to net-negative charge depending on the solution pH. The overall charge of the virus capsid arises as a consequence of a complicated balance with the chemical dissociation equilibrium of the amino acids and the electrostatic interaction between them, and the translational entropy of the mobile solution ions, i.e., counterion release. We show that to properly describe and predict the charging equilibrium of viral capsids in general, one needs to include molecular details as exemplified by the acid-base equilibrium of the detailed distribution of amino acids in the proteinaceous capsid shell.},

We show surface-induced correlations, excluded volume, and electrostatic forces are sufficient to predict most of the major features of the current structural data for DNA packaged within viral capsids without additional ordering due to elastic bending forces for the polymer. Current models assume highly-ordered, even spooled, hexagonally packed conformations based on interpretation of cryo-EM density maps. We show herein that the surface induced packing of short (6mer), unconnected DNA polymer segments is the only necessary ingredient in creating ringed densities consistent with experimental density maps. This implies the ensemble of possible conformations of polymeric DNA within the capsid that are consistent with cryo-EM data may be much larger than implied by traditional interpretations where such rings can only result from highly-ordered spool-like conformations. This opens the possibility of a more disordered, entropically-driven view of phage packaging thermodynamics. We also show the electrostatics of the DNA contributes a large portion of the internal hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of a phage virion, suggesting that nonlinear elastic anomalies might reduce the overall elastic bending enthalpy of more disordered conformations to have allowable free energies.},

	abstract = {We discuss how a balance can be established between the force acting to eject DNA from viral capsids and the force resisting its entry into a colloidal suspension which mimics the host cell cytoplasm. The ejection force arises from the energy stored in the capsid as a consequence of the viral genome (double-stranded DNA) being strongly bent and crowded on itself. The resisting force is associated with the osmotic pressure exerted by the colloidal particles in the host solution. Indeed, recent experimental work has demonstrated that the extent of ejection can be progressively limited by increasing the external osmotic pressure; at a sufficiently high pressure the ejection is completely suppressed. We outline here a theoritical analysis that allows a determination of the internal (capsid) pressure by examining the different relations between force and pressure inside and outside the capsid, using the experimentally measured position of the force balance.},

	abstract = {Cryo-EM maps are sensitive to total nuclear and electron charges of a species whereas X-ray crystallography only visualizes electrons without a nuclear contribution. Cryo-EM can be used to identify charge and chemical identity., Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) directly images the distribution of electrostatic potential (ESP) within macromolecules, and thus can provide much more information about atomic charge than X-ray crystallography. The electron-scattering length of an isolated ion is quite different from that of the corresponding neutral atom. The difference is very large at small scattering angles where the effects of electron distributions are largest, but becomes smaller at high scattering angles where nuclear charge determines outcomes. For this reason, in cryo-EM maps that have been solved at resolutions lower than ∼2.5 Å, peaks corresponding to anions will always be less prominent than those of cations, and may even be negative. Furthermore, if a map of this kind is smeared computationally after the fact, which reduces its effective resolution, anion peaks will diminish in size, cation peaks will grow and peaks that represent uncharged atoms will remain about the same. These effects can be used to determine the sign of the charges carried by the ions associated with a macromolecule and even estimate their magnitudes. The ESP value for a cation in a cation–anion pair is smaller than the value of the cation in isolation, but the ESP value for the anion in the ionic pair is greater than the value of the anion in isolation. The experimental range of ESP values for Mg2+ relative to that of the closest C1′ atom is found to be between 0.57 and 1.27.},

We have examined the proteins of a large number of representative eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses for the occurrence of significant clusters, runs, and periodic patterns of charge. Clusters and runs of positive charge are prominent in many capsid and core proteins, whereas surface (glyco)proteins frequently contain a negative charge cluster. Significant charge configurations are abundant in regulatory proteins implicated in transcriptional transactivation and cellular transformation. Proteins with charge structures are much more predominant in animal DNA viruses as compared to animal RNA viruses and prokaryotic viruses. This contrast might reflect the role of protein charge structures in facilitating competitive virus-host interactions involving the cellular transcription, translation, protein sorting, and transport apparatus.},

We compare the crystallographic structures of the capsids with unresolved N‐termini and without them in realistic conditions (room temperature and aqueous solution) and show that the structure is preserved. We find that the chloride ions play a key role in the stability of the capsid. A low number of chloride ions results in loss of the native icosahedral symmetry, while an optimal number of chloride ions create a neutralizing layer next to the positively charged inner surface of the capsid. Understanding the dependence of the capsid stability on the distribution of the ions will help clarify the details of the viral life cycle that is ultimately connected to the role of packaged viral genome inside the capsid.},

	abstract = {Influenza infection is associated with about 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations every year in the United States. The continuous emergence of new influenza virus strains due to mutation and re-assortment complicates the control of the virus and necessitates the permanent development of novel drugs and vaccines. The laboratory-based study of influenza requires a reliable and cost-effective method for the propagation of the virus. Here, a comprehensive protocol is provided for influenza A virus propagation in fertile chicken eggs, which consistently yields high titer viral stocks. In brief, serum pathogen-free (SPF) fertilized chicken eggs are incubated at 37 °C and 55-60\% humidity for 10-11 days. Over this period, embryo development can be easily monitored using an egg candler. Virus inoculation is carried out by injection of virus stock into the allantoic cavity using a needle. After 2 days of incubation at 37 °C, the eggs are chilled for at least 4 hr at 4 °C. The eggshell above the air sac and the chorioallantoic membrane are then carefully opened, and the allantoic fluid containing the virus is harvested. The fluid is cleared from debris by centrifugation, aliquoted and transferred to -80 °C for long-term storage. The large amount (5-10 ml of virus-containing fluid per egg) and high virus titer which is usually achieved with this protocol has made the usage of eggs for virus preparation our favorable method, in particular for in vitro studies which require large quantities of virus in which high dosages of the same virus stock are needed.},

Measurements made with nanowire arrays modified with antibodies for influenza A showed discrete conductance changes characteristic of binding and unbinding in the presence of influenza A but not paramyxovirus or adenovirus. Simultaneous electrical and optical measurements using fluorescently labeled influenza A were used to demonstrate conclusively that the conductance changes correspond to binding/unbinding of single viruses at the surface of nanowire devices. pH-dependent studies further show that the detection mechanism is caused by a field effect, and that the nanowire devices can be used to determine rapidly isoelectric points and variations in receptor-virus binding kinetics for different conditions. Lastly, studies of nanowire devices modified with antibodies specific for either influenza or adenovirus show that multiple viruses can be selectively detected in parallel. The possibility of large-scale integration of these nanowire devices suggests potential for simultaneous detection of a large number of distinct viral threats at the single virus level.},

	abstract = {Using panicum mosaic virus (PMV) and several St. Augustine decline strains of PMV (SAD) as test viruses, previously developed procedures of agarose gel electrophoresis (reviewed in P. Serwer, Electrophoresis 1983, 3, 375–382) have been used for the first time to detect and characterize plant viruses. PMV and some SAD strains produce two particles that copurify during rate zonal sedimentation, but form separate bands during agarose gel electrophoresis (forms 1 and 2). By measuring electrophoretic mobility (μ) as a function of agarose percentage and correcting for electroosmosis, it was found that: (a) form 1 has a solid support-free μ (μ0) different from the μ0 of form 2, and (b) forms 1 and 2 have the same radius (14.6 ± 0.6nm). Form 1 is indistinguishable from form 2 by either electron microscopy or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The μ0 of form 1 and the relative amount of forms 1 and 2 vary with the virus strain and can be used to help identify strains. A previously described satellite of PMV and some SAD strains also has two forms. The radius of the satellite of one SAD strain was found to be 7.6 ± 0.3 nm. A procedure of differential gel staining was developed for distinguishing the 14.6 nm virus from its 7.6 nm satellite. After agarose gel electrophoresis of either totally unfractionated or partially fractionated, infected grass extracts, virus particles wer detected without interference from host components. The procedures used here should be useful for rapid disease diagnosis and strain typing of the above and possibly other plant viruses.},

An analytical and progressive approach has been adopted. The simple addition of line sections at the end of the resonators of the reference structure validated the principle of the center frequency and bandwidth tuning. The use of varactor diodes as tuning elements allows continuous and independent control of these parameters. A bandwidth tunable filter, which is being manufactured, was simulated and the simulated results showed that the -3 dB relative bandwidth varies from 44\% to 16\% with a fixed center frequency at 2.7 GHz.},

The passband-width tunability is achieved by placing variable coupling reducers between the ﬁlter resonators. The coupling reducers, operating as bandwidth control subnetworks, are designed as detuned resonators made up of a line segment ending in a variable capacitor. The proposed ﬁlter structure is experimentally validated with the design, construction in suspended stripline technology, and characterization of a low-cost ﬁlter prototype for terrestrial digital video broadcasting receivers operating in the UHF band (470–862 MHz). Other relevant factors, such as the intermodulation distortion produced by the varactors used to control the bandwidth electronically or the power-handling performance of the constructed ﬁlter, are also discussed. The reconﬁgurable ﬁlter module described in this paper is very suitable for the design of ﬂexible multifunction receiver subsystems simultaneously supporting signals with a different bandwidth.},

	abstract = {Characterization of the frequency response of coherent radiometric receivers is a key element in estimating the flux of astrophysical emissions, since the measured signal depends on the convolution of the source spectral emission with the instrument band shape. Laboratory Radio Frequency (RF) measurements of the instrument bandpass often require complex test setups and are subject to a number of systematic effects driven by thermal issues and impedance matching, particularly if cryogenic operation is involved. In this paper we present an approach to modeling radiometers bandpasses by integrating simulations and RF measurements of individual components. This method is based on QUCS (Quasi Universal Circuit Simulator), an open-source circuit simulator, which gives the flexibility of choosing among the available devices, implementing new analytical software models or using measured S-parameters. Therefore an independent estimate of the instrument bandpass is achieved using standard individual component measurements and validated analytical simulations. In order to automate the process of preparing input data, running simulations and exporting results we developed the Python package python-qucs and released it under GNU Public License. We discuss, as working cases, bandpass response modeling of the COFE and Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) radiometers and compare results obtained with QUCS and with a commercial circuit simulator software. The main purpose of bandpass modeling in COFE is to optimize component matching, while in LFI they represent the best estimation of frequency response, since end-to-end measurements were strongly affected by systematic effects.},

isoelectric points for 5029 proteomes calculated using 18 methods. The isoelectric point,
the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important
parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D
gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry and X-ray protein crystallography. The database, available at http://isoelectricpointdb.org
allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customised fractions
of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover,
Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various
prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space
in all kingdoms of life. For instance, using Proteome-pI data, it is
clear that Eukaryotes, which evolved tight control of homeostasis, encode proteins with
pI values near the cell pH. In contrast, Archaea living frequently in
extreme environments can possess proteins with a wide range of isoelectric points. The
database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and
sorting. Apart from data for individual proteomes, datasets corresponding to major protein
databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr)
database have also been precalculated and made available in CSV format.},

Here, we review the IEP measurements of viruses that replicate in hosts of kingdom plantae, bacteria and animalia. IEPs of viruses are found in pH range from 1.9 to 8.4; most frequently, they are measured in a band of 3.5 {\textless} IEP {\textless} 7. However, the data appear to be scattered widely within single virus species. This discrepancy is discussed and should be considered when IEP values are used to account for virus sorption processes.},

	abstract = {Electrically tunable bandpass filters are crucial components in wireless communication system. In this paper, a combline filter structure is used to design an electrically tunable filter, whose working frequency range is 200MHz {\textasciitilde} 600MHz. In the entire tuning range, 1dB relative bandwidth is about 12\%, the insertion loss is less than 3dB, the input 2rd-order intercept point(IIP2) is more than 60dBm, the input 3th-order intercept point(IIP3) is more than 20dBm, and the input and output voltage standing wave ratio(VSWR) is less than 1.8. The test and simulation results are in good agreement. Finally, we apply this tunable filter to a 20MHz{\textasciitilde}1350MHz tuned filter bank and achieve good results.},

	abstract = {A thickened bronchial wall is the morphological substratum of most diseases of the airway. Theoretical and clinical models of bronchial morphometry have so far focused on bronchial lumen diameter, and bronchial length and angles, mainly assessed from bronchial casts. However, these models do not provide information on bronchial wall thickness. This paper reports in vivo values of cross-sectional wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter in ten healthy subjects as assessed by multi-detector computed tomography. A validated dedicated software package was used to measure these morphometric parameters up to the 14th bronchial generation, with respect to Weibel's model of bronchial morphometry, and up to the 12th according to Boyden's classification. Measured lumen diameters and homothety ratios were compared with theoretical values obtained from previously published studies, and no difference was found when considering dichotomic division of the bronchial tree. Mean wall area, lumen area, wall thickness and lumen diameter were then provided according to bronchial generation order, and mean homothety ratios were computed for wall area, lumen area and wall thickness as well as equations giving the mean value of each parameter for a given bronchial generation with respect to its value in generation 0 (trachea). Multi-detector computed tomography measurements of bronchial morphometric parameters may help to improve our knowledge of bronchial anatomy in vivo, our understanding of the pathophysiology of bronchial diseases and the evaluation of pharmacological effects on the bronchial wall.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Choosing the correct surgical staple height is dependent on knowledge of specific tissue thickness and compressibility. The purpose of this study was to measure the thickness of cadaveric human lung tissue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2012 and February 2013, whole lungs were procured from 12 donors. Inclusion criteria included negative serology, no prior thoracic surgery, and completion of measurements within 72 hours of death. Tissue thickness was measured in the anterior-to-posterior direction using a tissue measuring device (TMD) at 41 lung locations. The tissue measuring device applied a constant pressure (8 g/mm2) via a plunger for 15 seconds before reading the thickness.
RESULTS: Cadaveric lung tissue thickness displayed a large variation by location and within each location. Mean thickness in the anterior-to-posterior direction ranged from 1.5 mm (right middle lobe [inferior peripheral] location) to 9.0 mm (right inferior lobe [mid-central] location). In general, the periphery of the lung lobes was thinner than the central locations (e.g., mean peripheral location thickness: 4.1 mm; mean central location thickness: 5.9 mm). The thinnest tissues among the 12 donor cadaveric lung specimens were found in the one donor with a history of severe emphysema/chronic bronchitis. Height (P = 0.012) and weight (P = 0.036) were positively correlated with tissue thickness. Additionally, after adjusting for height, cadaveric lung tissue was 3.0 mm thicker for females than males.
CONCLUSIONS: Large variations of lung tissue thickness were demonstrated throughout the lung as well as within each measured location across different cadaveric specimens. Generally, peripheral locations were thinner than the central locations of the lobes. There was a strong positive correlation between thickness and height, and females had slightly thicker lung tissue than males of the same height.},

	abstract = {Background
Needle thoracostomy is the emergent treatment for tension pneumothorax. This procedure is commonly done using a 4.5cm catheter, and the optimal site for chest wall puncture is controversial. We hypothesize that needle thoracostomy cannot be performed using this catheter length irrespective of the site chosen in either gender.
Methods
A retrospective review of all chest computed tomography (CT) scans obtained on trauma patients from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 was performed. Patients aged 18 and 80 years were included and patients whose chest wall thickness exceeded the boundary of the images acquired were excluded. Chest wall thickness was measured at the 2nd intercostal (ICS), midclavicular line (MCL) and the 5th ICS, anterior axillary line (AAL). Injury severity score (ISS), chest wall thickness, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed.
Results
201 patients were included, 54\% male. Average (SD) BMI was 26 (7)kg/m2. The average chest wall thickness in the overall cohort was 4.08 (1.4)cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 4.55 (1.7)cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. 29\% of the overall cohort (27 male and 32 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 2nd ICS/MCL and 45\% (54 male and 36 female) had a chest wall thickness greater than 4.5cm at the 5th ICS/AAL. There was no significant interaction between gender and chest wall thickness at either site. BMI was positively associated with chest wall thickness at both the 2nd and 5th ICS/AAL.
Conclusion
A 4.5cm catheter is inadequate for needle thoracostomy in most patients regardless of puncture site or gender.},
