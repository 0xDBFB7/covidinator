This paper is not novel enough to deserve this chapter, but those to be acknowledged are.

The authors of the original papers deserve the credit for this entire work; it is rare that such a monumental finding is served on a silver platter.

Thanks to (Dr. ) Peter Barfuss for spending time reviewing early drafts.

This paper would have been absolutely impossible without the support of thousands of open-source software packages, ranging from monolithic nation-state supported tools like Paraview and Chimera to poorly-compensated but equally invaluable scripts like zonca. A special thanks to the dedicated authors that develop and maintain these tools.

Professor Shahramian's excellent video blog {\it The Signal Path} greatly informed this work. Dr. Dainis' videos on microbiological technique were also particularly useful.

Thanks to all the professors at York and beyond for returning my emails and checking their biofridges for phages.

GThanks to L.H. for wisdom regarding this project; and H.P. and ice9 for tolerating midnight ramblings and M.Q. for the hug.

Special thanks to all the people - all equally capable of writing this paper if provided the opportunity - who circumstance led to work menial shifts at the component suppliers that remained open that were so critical. Hopfstader be damned; despite the name below the abstract, this paper is of course entirely the result of circumstance and luck. 

Chiefly among the enablers are of course my parents, Doris and Brian, without whom this work would have been done by someone else, and who also supported this work financially.

The authors reluctantly acknowledge the Computational Electromagnetics Group at The University of Texas at Austin for going through the trouble to develop the AustinMan and AustinWoman human body models and then making them unavailable at https://sites.utexas.edu/austinmanaustinwomanmodels/, and also unavailable via email.

The authors acknowledge the IT.IS foundation for doing the same, but actually replying to emails.
