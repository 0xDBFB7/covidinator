This paper is not novel enough to deserve this chapter, but those to be acknowledged are.

The authors of the original papers deserve the credit for this entire work;  it is rare that such a monumental finding is served on a silver platter.

This paper would have been absolutely impossible without the support of hundreds of open-source software packages, ranging from monolithic industry-supported tools like Paraview and Chimera to poorly-compensated but equally invaluable scripts like zonca. Thank you to all the dedicated authors that develop and maintain these tools.

Professor Shahramian's excellent video blog {\it The Signal Path} inspired this work. 

Dr. Dainis' videos on microbiological technique were also useful. The Thought Emporium's videos on PCB prototyping and 

Thanks to all the professors at York and beyond for returning my emails and checking their biofridges.

Thanks to L.H. for wisdom regarding this project; P.B and H.P. and ice9 for tolerating midnight ramblings and M.Q. for the hug.

Special thanks to all the people - all equally capable of writing this paper if provided the opportunity - who circumstance led to work menial shifts at the component suppliers that remained open that were so critical. Hopfstader be damned; despite the name below the abstract, this paper is of course entirely the result of circumstance and luck. 

Chiefly among the enablers are of course my parents, Doris and Brian, without whom this work would have been done by someone else, and who also supported this work financially.
