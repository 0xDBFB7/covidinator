Previous studies appear to demonstrate that several species of viruses exhibit an anomalous dielectric relaxation time of $> 75 \text{ ps}$, as opposed to $< 20 \text{ ps}$ \footnotemark \dubiousdiscuss in the structures of human tissue.


Then, net charge, rings up and shatters, much like a singer might a wine glass. Such a non-thermal inactivation mechanism is quite unprecedented and extremely dubious, oft-posited but never substantiated; so it has taken some convincing that this is not a particularly abstruse artifact. The structure of the virion appears to fill a singular gap in existing solvent damping theory.\\


We contribute almost nothing to the record, except by apparently replicating the effect in a T4 coliphage surrogate, using both microwave feedback and a fluroimetric beta-galactosidase infectivity assay. We appear to demonstrate that inactivation does not require 15 minutes, but is complete in less than 500 nanoseconds. This provides a headroom of some $10^6$ to all safety limits. \\

We briefly review the biological basis for the safety. There is solid in vitro and limited in vivo evidence of safety in this regime.

\footnotetext{This value for human structures is the aggregate Cole-Cole relaxation time from Gabriel. This is an unfair comparison; the relaxation time of a heterogeneous mixture such as tissue often appears smaller than that of a pure sample. Additionally, it is probably not valid to compare a Cole-Cole tau. However, this value agrees well with the individual findings of cellular modes, so we are comfortable with this comparison. }

We examine three applications. First, free-space techniques are easily implemented to prevent respiratory transmission.
%
Second, via cursory FDTD simulations, using off-the-shelf equipment and modified non-invasive microwave diathermy techniques, it appears to be possible to inactivate all virions in the outer 2 cm of the lungs and inner 1 cm of the bronchi without any effect on the surrounding tissue. 
\\

With quite a bit more effort, by harnessing the dispersive nature of tissue using modulated Brillouin precursors noted by [], it may be possible to remove the virus from the body altogether.\\

The mechanism also provides a few distinctive microwave signatures that may be useful for detection; it remains to be seen whether these can be discerned in practice.

The claims above are extraordinary. We do not provide the extraordinary quality of evidence required to support them. Consider: is it more likely that an undergraduate in his parent's basement, with no experience in biology or microwave design, has misinterpreted a blip from a cobbled-together machine, or that

Not to be confused with pseudoscientific 'resonance therapies', nor reports of a connection with 5G communications.

This means that the technique is {\it selective}.

\end{itemize}\

With refinements, our inexpensive pulsed microwave spectrometer can obtain the required data with sufficiently concentrated specimens; but certain swept-EPR or ESR equipment may provide a much more sensitive spectrum \st{when used improperly} with modifications in technique. \\

It is perhaps notable that a completely free and open-source toolchain was used for the entire project.
