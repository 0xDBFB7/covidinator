\begin{abstract}
	Studies by the Sun group (Liu 2009, Yang 2015, Sun 2017) and (Burkhartsmeyer 2020) suggest that certain species of viruses have extraordinary dielectric properties which are not found in other biological systems. Unlike historical reports these do not appear to be ruled out by basic classical physics. We have attempted to replicate with a slightly improved thermal sham on Bacteriophage T4 in the 6 - 11.5 GHz band with Xie's sweet amplification-free fluorescence assay, but have been unable to attain the required >150 V/m field magnitude due to poor experimental design - nor is T4 a good surrogate. We therefore contribute nothing to the scientific record; most of our discussion is not novel and is primarily qualitative.\\
	
	
	 We have some reservations regarding aspects of the previous research and recommend great care in interpretation. With some imagination, the results can be ascribed purely to characteristic artifacts in this field. We also believe there may be inconsistencies in the observed protein charge and coupling by many orders of magnitude. If this effect exists, and inactivation is found to take place in less than$~10^6$ cycles, it appears to suggest a straightforward treatment, particularly in the sub-microsecond pulse regime, and especially when driven by Brillouin precursors.

Given that every route persued consumes precious resources and attention that might be more effective in 
other routes...



Based on artifacts previously observed in the nonthermal effects literature, we can create scenarios in which all of the methods are simultaneously wrong. 

\section{Aims}





Legend:  \cmark $ = $ crude experiment, not nearly definitive, needs more work $\vert$ $\thicksim$ $ = $ crude experiment, not nearly definitive, needs more work $\vert$ \xmark \ $ = $ definitely not complete.\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Establishing the time dependence of inactivation in surrogate bacteriophage $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Demonstrating a modulation scheme that decreases the inactivation threshold to below current safety levels in surrogate bacteriophage $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Demonstrating a prototype emitter in an "electromagnetic mask" form-factor, costing about \$5 in prototype quantities, which can reasonably be produced in 10 million-of quantities $\vert$ $\thicksim$
  \item Testing power thresholds in various conditions; biological fluids of various conductivities and pHs $\vert$ \xmark
  \item Synthesizing a coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulation of the mechanism $\vert$ \xmark
  \item Discussing the biological basis for the safety of the device $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Showing that the deviation from the expected threshold can be explained by variance in the viron $\vert$ \cmark

It is perhaps notable that a completely free and open-source toolchain was used for the entire project (with one exception).
