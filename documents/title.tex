	We have considerable reservations regarding their methodology and technique; best practices in this field do not appear to have been followed.

Given that every route persued consumes precious resources and attention that might be more effective in 
other routes...



Based on artifacts previously observed in the nonthermal effects literature, we can create scenarios in which all of the methods are simultaneously wrong. 

\section{Aims}





Legend:  \cmark $ = $ crude experiment, not nearly definitive, needs more work $\vert$ $\thicksim$ $ = $ crude experiment, not nearly definitive, needs more work $\vert$ \xmark \ $ = $ definitely not complete.\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Establishing the time dependence of inactivation in surrogate bacteriophage $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Demonstrating a modulation scheme that decreases the inactivation threshold to below current safety levels in surrogate bacteriophage $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Demonstrating a prototype emitter in an "electromagnetic mask" form-factor, costing about \$5 in prototype quantities, which can reasonably be produced in 10 million-of quantities $\vert$ $\thicksim$
  \item Testing power thresholds in various conditions; biological fluids of various conductivities and pHs $\vert$ \xmark
  \item Synthesizing a coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulation of the mechanism $\vert$ \xmark
  \item Discussing the biological basis for the safety of the device $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Showing that the deviation from the expected threshold can be explained by variance in the viron $\vert$ \cmark
  
\end{itemize}\

It is perhaps notable that a completely free and open-source toolchain was used for the entire project (with one exception).
