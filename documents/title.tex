	It has previously been suggested that viruses may possess interesting dielectric properties; in particular, a substantial charge distribution and a relatively long relaxation time. If the duration of exposure is sufficiently short that thermal and membrane breakdown effects can be neglected, tissue appears to withstand peak electric fields of great magnitude - above 1 nanosecond megavolt/meter, even in in-vivo studies - without severe acute effects.\\
	
	Given these assumptions, past experiments have suggested that there might some scope to produce mechanical forces sufficient to disrupt the viral membrane without acutely damaging the surrounding tissue. \\
	
	Due to profound incompetence and an unhealthy preoccupation with methodology and instrumentation, we have not been able to present even a tenuous physical or experimental basis for or against such an effect.\\
	
	We have conducted a series of sloppy and haphazard experiments on bacteriophage T4, which have yielded no new results. Having only mustered a field of about 1 MV/m in the nanosecond pulse regime and about 70 V/m in the microsecond pulsed X-band regime, we have not yet been able to replicate the exposure conditions or results of previous studies. A generous reader might regard this as a negative result. A neat fluorescence technique was used to obtain these data, but this is not novel. \\
	
	One interesting finding is that, in certain cases, due to the Brillouin precursors, the minimum-amplitude waveform to maximally drive an oscillator through a lossy dispersive medium like tissue appears to be simply a sawtooth.\\
	
	While there may be an under-explored regime of pulse duration on the order of the virion relaxation time, $50 \text{ ps} < \text{dt} < 1 \text{ ns}$,  it seems most likely that the required field will exceed practical limits.\\
	
	If the rotational relaxation time turns out to be longer than that of oscillatory modes, it could be worth investigating the plausibility of rupturing the virus by optical centrifuge; synchronously rotating and chirping the polarization axis of a train of intense Brillouin pulses, using the virion as a kind of electrostatic induction motor. Some precedent exists for such a concept; but there is no reason to believe that this can be made practical or effective.\\
	
	Given that every avenue pursued consumes precious resources and attention, together with the TRL 0 nature of the effect, in retrospect, this was probably not a good use of time.\\
	
	It is perhaps notable that an entirely free and open-source software toolchain was used for the entire project; all instruments were custom-built and relatively inexpensive; and the results are hopefully replicable by workers without biology equipment for under \$5000.

%	I am comfortable making such a definitive statement.

%	The power levels required to even begin to observe this inactivation effect in practice are so high that, if conditions are not specifically tailored for clinical use, extensive burns will result within seconds. Even in this case, the effect is to eviscerate the virus, not to aid its spread.

%	Moreover, these frequency bands have been in almost continuous use not long after Jagadish Chandra Bose 1894; the world has been bathed in high-power 10 GHz pulses at least since the commissioning of the first centimeter-wave weather radars in 1959.
