\begin{abstract}
	It has been suggested that the charge distribution and solvent damping of some species of viruses might offer some scope for inactivation by extreme electric fields, through mechanisms similar to - but distinct from - well-established bilayer electroporation effects.\\

	A series of haphazard experiments on bacteriophage T4 have yielded no novel results. With a field of $10^6$ V/m in the nanosecond pulse regime and $10^2$ V/m in the microsecond pulsed 6 to 12 GHz regime, we have not replicated the conditions or results of previous studies, especially considering the lack of a lipid envelope in the chosen surrogate. A generous reader might regard this as a negative result. Pulse shaping, a central interest of this study, was not employed due to a lack of diagnostic equipment.\\
	
	Due to wide error bars and an unhealthy preoccupation with methodology and instrumentation, we have not been able to contribute even a tenuous theoretical or experimental basis for, or against, such an effect. It is hoped that this work will be of some small use in suggesting some lines of inquiry for future efforts, and in reporting some pitfalls encountered.\\
	
	Optimization suggests that in certain cases, due to the Brillouin precursors, the minimum-amplitude waveform to maximally drive the virion when propagated through a lossy, dispersive medium like tissue may be simply a sawtooth.\\
	
	 Modifications to existing irreversible electroporation therapies may be plausible; some precedent also exists for more far fetched routes such as optical centrifuge and electrorotation; but we have not studied these techniques in any depth and have no reason to believe that they can be made practical or effective.\\
	
	Given that every avenue pursued consumes precious resources and attention, together with the TRL 0 nature of the effect, in retrospect, this was probably not a good use of time.\\
	% if it is the goal of every scientist to establish a firm footing for future researchers, and to produce experiments which do not need to be repeated, we have failed to do so.
	
	An entirely free and open-source software toolchain was used for the majority of the project, and all instruments required are relatively inexpensive to build; and so the results are hopefully replicable by any interested workers.
%	
%	It has previously been suggested that viruses may possess interesting dielectric properties; in particular, a substantial charge distribution and a relatively long relaxation time. If the duration of exposure is sufficiently short that thermal and membrane breakdown effects can be neglected, tissue appears to withstand peak electric fields of great magnitude - above 1 nanosecond megavolt/meter, even in in-vivo studies - without severe acute effects.\\
%	
%	Given these assumptions, past experiments have suggested that there might some scope to produce mechanical forces sufficient to disrupt the viral membrane without acutely damaging the surrounding tissue, especially if the pulse spectrum is well matched to the normal modes of the virus.
%	
%	Due to a lack of competence and an unhealthy preoccupation with methodology and instrumentation, we have not been able to contribute even a tenuous theoretical or experimental basis for, or against, such an effect.\\
%	
%	We have conducted a series of haphazard experiments on bacteriophage T4, which have yielded no new results. Having only mustered a field of about 1 MV/m in the nanosecond pulse regime and about 150 V/m in the microsecond pulsed X-band regime, we have not yet been able to replicate the exposure conditions or results of previous studies, especially considering the lack of a lipid envelope in the chosen surrogate. A generous reader might regard this as a negative result. Pulse shaping, a central thesis of this study, was not employed due to a lack of picosecond feedback.\\
%	
%	One interesting finding is that, in certain cases, due to the Brillouin precursors, the minimum-amplitude waveform to maximally drive an oscillator through a lossy dispersive medium like tissue appears to be simply a sawtooth.\\
%	
%	While there may be an under-explored regime of pulse duration on the order of the virion relaxation time, $50 \text{ ps} < \text{dt} < 1 \text{ ns}$,  it seems most likely that the required field will exceed practical limits. It is possible that modifications to existing DC irreversible electroporation therapies might yield some differential effectiveness; we have not investigated this.\\
%	
%	If the rotational relaxation time turns out to be longer than that of oscillatory modes, it could be worth investigating the plausibility of rupturing the virus by optical centrifuge; synchronously rotating and chirping the polarization axis of a train of intense Brillouin pulses. Some precedent exists for such a concept; but there is no reason to believe that this can be made practical or effective.\\
%	
%	Given that every avenue pursued consumes precious resources and attention, together with the TRL 0 nature of the effect, in retrospect, this was probably not a good use of time; and effort is certainly better directed to vaccine deployment.\\
%	
%	An entirely free and open-source software toolchain was used for the majority of the project; all instruments are relatively inexpensive to build; and so the results are hopefully replicable by any interested workers.

%	I am comfortable making such a definitive statement.
%	
%	The power levels required to even begin to observe this inactivation effect in practice are so high that, if conditions are not specifically tailored for clinical use, extensive burns will result within seconds. Even in this case, the effect is to eviscerate the virus, not to aid its spread.

%	Moreover, these frequency bands have been in almost continuous use not long after Jagadish Chandra Bose 1894; the world has been bathed in high-power 10 GHz pulses at least since the commissioning of the first centimeter-wave weather radars in 1959.
