	It has previously been suggested that viruses may possess interesting dielectric properties; in particular, a substantial charge distribution and a relatively long relaxation time. If the duration of exposure is sufficiently short that thermal and membrane breakdown effects can be neglected, tissue appears to withstand peak electric fields of great magnitude - above 1 nanosecond megavolt/meter, even in in-vivo studies - without severe acute effects.\\
	
	Given these assumptions, past experiments have suggested that there might some scope to produce mechanical forces sufficient to disrupt the viral membrane without acutely damaging the surrounding tissue. We present only the most tenuous physical basis for such an effect. \\
	
	We have conducted a series of haphazard experiments on bacteriophage T4, which have yielded no new results; having only mustered a field of about 1 MV/m, we have not yet been able to replicate previous studies.\\
	
	One interesting finding is that the minimum-amplitude waveform which maximally drives an oscillator through a lossy dispersive medium appears to be a simple sawtooth.\\
	
	%Another route that might be worth investigating further is that it 
	It could be worth investigating the plausibility of rupturing the virus by optical centrifuge; that is, by inducing electrorotation by synchronously chirping the polarization axis of a MV/m Brillouin pulse along with the virus.

%In a series of experiments on bacteriophage T4, we have been unable to replicate previous research demonstrating the release of the genome after exposure to pulses at $0.7 \times 10^6 V/m \pm ~0.4 \times 10^6 V/m$ amplification-free fluorescence assay.

%Experiments in the field of bioelectrodynamics pose peculiar challenges in obtaining a meaningful result.

%Because this is a TRL 0 technique,

%
%
%We therefore have some vague reservations regarding aspects of the previous research and recommend great care in interpretation. With some imagination, the results can be ascribed purely to characteristic artifacts in this field. We also believe there may be inconsistencies in the observed protein charge and coupling by many orders of magnitude. However, unlike historical reports, these effects do not appear to be ruled out by basic classical physics.\\

%This project has been an abject failure in many interesting and notable ways, particularly in redirecting effort and resources from more plausible mechanisms - or even the local community - towards some half-baked pseudoscientific nonsense.

Given that every route persued consumes precious resources and attention that might be more effective in 
other routes...



Based on artifacts previously observed in the nonthermal effects literature, we can create scenarios in which all of the methods are simultaneously wrong.

	{\Large {This has \textbf{nothing to do} with 5G communications.}}\\
	
	I am comfortable making such a definitive statement.
	
	The power levels required to even begin to observe this inactivation effect in practice are so high that, if conditions are not specifically tailored for clinical use, extensive burns will result within seconds. Even in this case, the effect is to eviscerate the virus, not to aid its spread. 
	
	Moreover, these frequency bands have been in almost continuous use not long after Jagadish Chandra Bose 1894; the world has been bathed in high-power 10 GHz pulses at least since the commissioning of the first centimeter-wave weather radars in 1959. 
	
	Countless far more prosaic explanations exist in the modern world, such as air travel.
	
	If you have any concerns regarding this statement, please contact me. I would be happy to discuss this.

It is perhaps notable that a completely free and open-source toolchain was used for the entire project (with one exception).
