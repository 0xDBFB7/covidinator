	In particular, a long relaxation time 
	
	Work by the Sun group (Liu 2009, Yang 2015, Sun 2017) and (Dykeman 2009) and 
	(Burkhartsmeyer 2020) suggests that certain species of viruses may have remarkable dielectric 
	properties which are not found in other biological systems. More importantly, they appear to 
	demonstrate that, due to this effect, high power densities in the X-band can tear the envelope, 
	inactivating the virus. \\
	
	We have attempted to replicate with a slightly improved thermal sham on Bacteriophage T4 in the 6 - 11.5 GHz band with Xu's slick amplification-free fluorescence assay. T4 does not appear to exhibit this effect, but this is to be expected as T4's protein capsid is $\approx 5 \times$ more resilient than the lipid envelope of Inf. A et al. T4 is not a good surrogate.\\
	
	 We therefore contribute nothing to the scientific record; most of our discussion is not novel and is primarily qualitative.\\

	 Experiments in the field of microwave biophysics pose peculiar challenges in obtaining a meaningful result. In the process of performing a literature review for this paper, a variety of existential crises regarding we lost confidence in the concept of reliable measurement itself.\\
	 
	 We therefore have some vague reservations regarding aspects of the previous research and recommend great care in interpretation. With some imagination, the results can be ascribed purely to characteristic artifacts in this field. We also believe there may be inconsistencies in the observed protein charge and coupling by many orders of magnitude. However, unlike historical reports, these effects do not appear to be ruled out by basic classical physics.\\
	 
	It seems important to note that most published papers in this field are wrong. There is no reason to believe that this is any different.
	
	Sufficient high-quality evidence does not appear to exist to definitively confirm or refute 
	this effect.
	
	There does not appear to be sufficient clinical evidence to determine safety. What evidence does exist in this regime suggests few acute symptoms, but carcinogenicity as a possible long-term side-effect. 
	
	As almost a dozen clinical trials using ionizing radiation therapies are being undertaken, possible carcinogenicity of treatment does not seem to be a great impediment. \cite{LowDose2020}

	Is sensitive to parameters for which we do not have even an order-of-magnitude guess.

	Unduly preoccupied with matters of instrumentation and methodology - things which have nothing to do with viruses; and so no base truths have been arrived at. 
	
	muster a field of about 100 kV/m. 
	
	there are fundamental gaps in understanding
	
	400 times as effective at penetrating tissue. 
	
	TRL 0 and no resources should be redirected.
	
	This project has been an abject failure in many interesting and notable ways, particularly in redirecting effort and resources from more plausible mechanisms - or even the local community - towards some half-baked pseudoscientific nonsense.

H. H. Williams: Furious activity is no substitute for understanding.

Given that every route persued consumes precious resources and attention that might be more effective in 
other routes...



Based on artifacts previously observed in the nonthermal effects literature, we can create scenarios in which all of the methods are simultaneously wrong. 

\section{Aims}




\begin{autem}
	
	{\Large {This has \textbf{nothing to do} with 5G communications.}}\\
	
	I am comfortable making such a definitive statement.
	
	The power levels required to even begin to observe this inactivation effect in practice are so high that, if conditions are not specifically tailored for clinical use, extensive burns will result within seconds. Even in this case, the effect is to eviscerate the virus, not to aid its spread. 
	
	Moreover, these frequency bands have been in almost continuous use not long after Jagadish Chandra Bose 1894; the world has been bathed in high-power 10 GHz pulses at least since the commissioning of the first centimeter-wave weather radars in 1959. 
	
	Countless far more prosaic explanations exist in the modern world, such as air travel.
	
	If you have any concerns regarding this statement, please contact me. I would be happy to discuss this.
