(Not to be confused with pseudoscientific, non-specific "microwave resonance therapies", nor the ) 

We extend this landmark work rather trivially by:\\


Aims:
this is primarily bookkeeping.\\

Legend:  \cmark $ = $ crude experiment, not nearly definitive, needs more work $\vert$ $\thicksim$ $ = $ crude experiment, not nearly definitive, needs more work $\vert$ \xmark \ $ = $ definitely not.\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Establishing the time dependence of inactivation in surrogate bacteriophage $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Demonstrating a modulation scheme that decreases the inactivation threshold to below current safety levels in surrogate bacteriophage $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Demonstrating a prototype emitter in an "electromagnetic mask" form-factor, costing about \$5 in prototype quantities, which can reasonably be produced in 10 million-of quantities $\vert$ $\thicksim$
  \item Testing power thresholds in various conditions; biological fluids of various conductivities and pHs $\vert$ \xmark
  \item Synthesizing a coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulation of the mechanism $\vert$ \xmark
  \item Discussing the biological basis for the safety of the device $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Showing that the deviation from the expected threshold can be explained by variance in the viron, and that  $\vert$ \cmark
  \item Taking 4 months to design a circuit with 2 transistors, thereby potentially leading to the maiming of hundreds of thousands of people and causing untold economic losses $\vert$ \cmark
  
\end{itemize}\



It is perhaps notable that a completely free and open-source toolchain was used for the entire project.
